This is cleaned up version of Poplog sources, currently only
core part.  It misses build scripts, binary needed for boostrap,
documentation and extentions (packages).  You can find link
to buildable tarball for Intel/AMD 64-bit Linux at

http://www.math.uni.wroc.pl/~hebisch/poplog

(this build version closely corresponding to repository).

To get version containing documentation and packages you
can use
