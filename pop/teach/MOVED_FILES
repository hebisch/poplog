-- Introduction -------------------------------------------------------

A major reorganisation in January 2005 for Poplog Version 15.6
involved

o discarding a lot of out of date (and in some cases incorrect or
  non-functioning) documentation and library files, using
  the directory
        $usepop/pop/discarded/
  whose contents will later be removed from poplog distribuions

o moving teaching related programs and documentation concerned with
  AI or cognitive science, as opposed to pop11 programming from
    $usepop/pop/teach
  into a suitable sub-directory of
    $usepop/pop/packges/teaching

o installing more up to date library and documentation files previously
  distributed in the bham.tar.gz package which was part of the 'bham'
  linux popoplog distribution. Some of these have been included in

    $usepop/pop/teach

  others in a suitable sub-directory of
    $usepop/pop/packges/teaching

-- Summary of changes -------------------------------------------------

-- -- Files moved to $usepop/pop/discarded/teach

These are either replaced by more up to date versions or no longer
relevant:

    recurse1
    respond

The files in the 'discarded' directory will be removed later.
Users who do not need them can remove that directory now.
That should apply to anyone now installing poplog for the
first time.

Compare the newer files in the teaching/teach subdirectory.
