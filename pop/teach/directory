TEACH DIRECTORY                                       A. Sloman Oct 1988

A part of the magnetic  disk is reserved for you,  and is known as  your
directory. Files which you create are stored in this directory. It is
possible to create sub-directories which contain more files, including
sub-directories of sub-directories.

There is an upper limit to the amount of  space which you can use for
files,  so occasionally you will need to get rid of old files.
