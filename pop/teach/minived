TEACH MINIVED                                         Aaron Sloman October 2011

This is a very quick introduction to the Ved/Xved editor, which can also serve
as a reminder of the minimum set of operations you need to know about in order
to try out examples in teach files.

CONTENTS - (Use <ENTER> g to access required sections)

 -- Familiar operations:
 -- Doing without function keys
 -- Using the Function keys:
 -- Marking and doing things with a 'range' of text
 -- The Command line/Status line
 -- -- Giving a command
 -- -- Example:
 -- Switching Ved files
 -- More teach files

You can go direct to a section: Put the editor cursor on the section
title then do <ENTER> g <RETURN>

Use the DOWN ARROW key to read on.

-- Familiar operations: -----------------------------------------------

    Use DownArrow to scroll down

    Use UpArrow to scroll up

    Use Left and Right Arrow keys to move the Ved text cursor in a line

    Use PageDown and PageUp to move a screenful at time, up or down.

    Use the BackSpace or Delete keys to delete character to left of text cursor
        [For historical reasons, Ved does not treat those two keys
        differently. It can be programmed to do so, if needed. Ask how.]

-- Doing without function keys ----------------------------------------

The rest of this file gives information on how to perform actions on
files in Ved and XVed many of which require use of function keys,
including, for example, the Arrow keys, the top-row keys F1,F2,F3,...
the ENTER key on far right of numeric keypad and others. On some
keyboards (e.g. laptops) not all the function keys will be present.
Moreover, some operating systems and interfaces for remote access "grab"
some of the function keys for their own purposes. In such contexts it is
possible to use Ved without making use of anything but the alphanumeric
keys, the normal printing symbol keys (e.g. ! " # $ < > etc.) and two
special keys usually marked CTRL and ESC.

To find out how to do everything with those keys please see:

    TEACH ESSENTIALKEYS

(put your text cursor between those two words, and type ESC then h)


-- Using the Function keys: -------------------------------------------

    Use Function key F4 to delete the line the text cursor is on
        (you can undo that, by using ESC F4 -- only the last line
        deleted by F4 is remembered by ESC F4.)

    Use Function key F3 to delete the PART-LINE to the left of the text cursor

    Use Function key F5 to delete the PART-LINE to the right of the text cursor

    Use Function key F6 or F7 to delete the WORD to the left (F6) or the
        right (F7) of the text cursor. What counts as a word is defined
        by the needs of the pop11 programming language.

-- Marking and doing things with a 'range' of text --------------------

    In ved, a range is a continuous set of lines, e.g. lines 3 to 7.
    A range can contain just one line.

    Use Function key F1 to mark the beginning of a range in the buffer
        alternatively use ESC m

    Use Function key F2 to mark the end of a range in the buffer
        alternatively use ESC M

    To load a marked range (lmr) i.e. compile it, do
        ENTER lmr RETURN
    OR
        <CTRL>-d  (Hold down CTRL, tap d key)

    To compile only one line, the line containing the text cursor do
        <ESC> d  (Press ESC key, release it, tap 'd')

-- The Command line/Status line ---------------------------------------

Above the current text buffer Ved displays a "status" line showing
    line number, the last command given, the file name

and other information. The status line can also be used to give
commands.

-- -- Giving a command
   Doing this requires three actions:

    1. put the Ved cursor on the status line: <ENTER>
    2. type your command
    3. use <RETURN> to get the command obeyed.

To move the Ved cursor to the command line use
    the ENTER key on the right hand numeric keypad,

    NOT the ENTER/Return key below the backspace key.

If you don't have a keypad (e.g. on a laptop) or the ENTER key on yours
does not move the cursor to command line then instead of ENTER use
    CTRL g  (Hold down CTRL, tap G key).

The format of a VED command is
    <ENTER> <command> <RETURN>

-- -- Example:

    <ENTER> teach mark <RETURN>

That will display the 'TEACH MARK' file. For now, immediately quit that
file with
    <ENTER> q <RETURN>

That can be abbreviated to <ESC> q

If you quit a teach file, all edits will be lost. You can rename the file to
be one of your files, e.g.

    <ENTER> name myfile.p <RETURN>

Then to save your work (write the current file to the hard drive):

    <ENTER> w1 <RETURN>

Then you can quit. Later come back and do 'ved myfile.p'


-- Switching Ved files ------------------------------------------------

When you are editing more than one file in Ved (e.g. a teach file and an
output.p file) you can switch between them using
    <ESC> x (Hold down ESC key, release it, tab 'x')

There are more ways of switching between files in the Ved buffer, e.g.
using the 'Rotate buffer' command:

    <ENTER> rb

or  <ESC> e
which shows a selection of files in Ved. Type a number to select one.

-- More teach files ---------------------------------------------------

A quick way to fetch these without typing ENTER teach xxxx RETURN
    1. move the cursor between TEACH and the topic word where the
       asterisk is: *

    2. type ESC h  (i.e. tap the <ESC> key, then tap the 'h' key)

To learn do all the above without using function keys, see:

    TEACH * ESSENTIALKEYS
