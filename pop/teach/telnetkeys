-- Introduction: using Ved in "dumb terminal" mode --------------------

If you use telnet to log through to a machine running Ved you may be on
a terminal where the function keys do not work as you expect them to,
e.g. because the machine does not distinguish the "ENTER" key and the
"RETURN" key, and the arrow keys may not work as expected.

The key combinations described below do not require any special function
keys or arrow keys: you can get by using only the Contrl and Esc keys,
along with normal typewriter keys (alphabetic, numeric and symbol keys).

You may also find that you cannot use XVed either because you are not
using a machine that supports X window facilities, or because the
connection is too slow or for some other reason.

In that situation you may find it useful to use VED in its "dumb
terminal" mode where there is always only one window in which everything
is visible, though VED allows you to have that window divided
horizontally in two, so that you can see two files at a time.

You can have more than two files in the editor, e.g. a teach file,
some help files, your program file, and the output file, but only two of
them visible at any time. You can then switch to looking at one of the
non-visible files using the techniques described below.

-- Working without function keys --------------------------------------

You can use the following key combinations to perform functions that are
normally performed using special function keys.

Here the symbol "^" means

    "hold down the Control key while you click on the key shown.

e.g. "^G" means hold down Control and then tap the G key. The control
key should go down first, and should remain down until after you have
pressed the other key.

The symbol "ESC" means

    Press and then release the key marked "Esc" or "Escape"

Notice that in the former case the first key remains held down while the
second is pressed, whereas in the second case you release the first key
before pressing the second key. Here are some of the most useful
combinations of Control and Escape keys with other keys.

-- Handling multiple buffers ------------------------------------------

The following file gives useful information on how to cope with multile
buffers in VED when you cannot see all of the files at once.
