TEACH CONTINUATIONS                              Chris Mellish, May 1983

The paper available as  DOC CONTINUATION is a  short description of  how
Prolog has been implemented in the POPLOG environment, and in particular
of how "continuation passing" has been used to implement backtracking.

The paper is not completely up to date, but gives a good summary of  the
ideas  of  continuation   passing.  In  particular,   for  more   recent
information about how Prolog terms are represented, see the Prolog  help
file TERMSINPOP.
