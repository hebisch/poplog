TEACH ONEOF

TEACH * MATCHES and TEACH * LISTS; shows you how to get the first, or
last, or some other specified element of a list.  The procedure ONEOF
selects an element at random. Try these:

    oneof([a b c d]) =>
    oneof([1 2 3]) =>
    oneof([men women children]) =>

Try the following:

    repeat 5 times
        oneof([tom dick harry]) =>
    endrepeat;


Or to get something out of a list of lists:

    repeat 8 times
      oneof( oneof( [ [a b c] [1 2 3] [true false] ] ) ) =>
    endrepeat;

Make sure you get all the brackets and spaces right, or else you'll
need to retype it!
