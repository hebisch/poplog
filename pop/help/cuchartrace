HELP CUCHARTRACE                                 John Williams, May 1986

    <procedure | false> -> cuchartrace

This variable determines where trace printout appears. If its value is
FALSE, then trace output is passed to *CUCHAROUT, the default character
consumer. Otherwise the value of CUCHARTRACE should be a character
consumer procedure, to which trace output will be sent.

For example, to make trace printout appear in a file called 'tracing',
do

    discout('tracing') -> cuchartrace;


KNOWN BUGS
----------

If you are using cuchartrace with a discout(<filename>) asigned
then tracing a procedure that was passed <termin> as an argument or a
procedure that returned <termin> as a result will cause the trace file
<filename> to be closed.
