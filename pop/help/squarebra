HELP SQUAREBRA                                      Steven Hardy, March 1982

Square brackets, [ and ], tell the POP-11 system to build a list of the items
between the brackets. These items are not evaluated unless surrounded by
percents (see HELP *PERCENT) or preceded by an up-arrow (see TEACH *ARROW).

See TEACH *BRACKETS for a tutorial introduction to the use of brackets in
POP-11, and TEACH *LISTS for a tutorial introduction to lists.

See also HELP
    *TWIDDLYBRA
    *ROUNDBRA       - for other types of brackets in POP-11 syntax
