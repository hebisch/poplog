<ENTER> cshfile <optional file name>

This VED command creates a file, with name defaulting to "cshfile",
whose associated compiler (the value of POPCOMPILER) is CSH_COMPILE.
When this is invoked it sends input to a process created by invoking
/bin/csh

<ENTER> shfile <optional file name>

This is similar except that it uses SH_COMPILE and /bin/sh

Any lines loaded using VED_LMR (load marked range) are sent to the
c-shell or shell as commands. The mechanism may be invoked in 'immediate
mode' using the IMCSH or IMSH command.

See the following HELP files:
    * IMCSH * CSH_COMPILE, * KILLCSH, * IMSH
            - explain related facilities, INCLUDING BUGS

    * MARK  - on marking a range of lines in VED
    * LMR   - Load marked range
