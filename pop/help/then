Used to terminate conditions in conditional statements.

See HELP
    *CONDITIONALS - summary of conditional statements; all use THEN
    *IF           - detailed instructions on use of IF statements
    *UNLESS       - summary of UNLESS statement usage
    *SWITCHON     - permits abbreviation of multi-branch conditionals
    *DO           - use of DO as a substitute for THEN
