-- *ved_jcp, justify current procedure ---------------------------------

<ENTER> jcp
    Inserts and deletes spaces so that the code in the procedure that
    surrounds the cursor is indented neatly.

-- *ved_j,   justify marked ranged -------------------------------------

<ENTER> j
    If the marked range is in a text file, it moves words at line breaks
    so as to fill the lines up to the margin (if possible). Otherwise,
    if it is in a program file, it indents the code, in the same way as
    ved_jcp, but only in the marked range.

-- *ved_jp,  justify paragraph -----------------------------------------

<ENTER> jp
    Moves words at line breaks in the current paragraph, so that lines fit
    into the margins. No need to mark the paragraph.

-- *ved_jj,  left and right justify marked range -----------------------

<ENTER> jj
    Align the text in the marked range with both the left and right margins,
    by inserting spaces between words.

-- *ved_jjp, left and right justify current paragraph ------------------

<ENTER> jjp
    Align the text in the current paragraph with both the left and right
    margins, by inserting spaces between words. No need to mark the
    paragraph.

-- more on justifying procedures --------------------------------------

    To be able to justify program code, the justifying procedures must
know when to increase the indentation level, and when to decrease it.
They do this by looking in the two lists *VEDOPENERS and *VEDCLOSERS. As
might be expected, VEDOPENERS contains the words that indicate where
indentation is to be increased, and VEDCLOSERS contains the words that
indicate where indentation is to be decreased.

E.g. a neat piece of code may look like this :-

if foo = 1 then
    baz();
endif;

Therefore the word if is contained in VEDOPENERS, and the word endif is
contained in VEDCLOSERS.
