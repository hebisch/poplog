HELP PRNUM                             Revised by A.Sloman March 1987

    prnum(<number>, <integer1>, <integer2>)

The autoloadable library procedure PRNUM prints numbers according to a
floating-point format specified by its three arguments.

1) <number> is the number to be printed
2) <integer1> specifies the maximum number of digits allowed for
    that part of the number preceding the decimal point (including a
    minus sign if necessary)
3) <integer2> specifies the number of digits allowed after the decimal
    point (including the decimal point itself).

The item to be printed can be any real (non-complex) number.

If <integer2> is zero the number is printed as an integer.

Unless <integer2> is 0, trailing zeroes are printed to give an
indication of the accuracy to which the number is being printed.
