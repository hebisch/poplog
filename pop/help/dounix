ENTER dounix

This command will take the current line in the VED buffer and run it as
a unix command, as if you had typed
    ENTER unix <command>

E.g. put the cursor on each of the next line and type ENTER dounix

    who
    ls -l

If there is any output from the Unix command it is read into a new Ved
buffer.
