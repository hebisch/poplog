        A TURTLE PACKAGE BASED ON THE VED EDITOR
        ========================================

A more detailed 'interactive' explanation is found in TEACH VTURTLE.

The VED TURTLE is made available by the command

    lib vturtle;

This makes available most of the procedures in the standard POP11 turtle
package (see HELP * TURTLE)

The picture is drawn in a file whose name is the value of the variable
POPTURTLEFILE, which defaults to 'PICTURE'. If it is FALSE, the current file
is used. The current location of the turtle is represented by the variables
xposition and yposition.

For a tutorial introduction , type

    TEACH * VTURTLE.

A sequence of commands can be given from inside the editor by marking the
range and using CTRL-D, to invoke the 'load marked range' procedure.

Alternatively, go to the command line (ENTER) type a colon, then give the
turtle commands.
