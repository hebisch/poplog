<ENTER> copy

This command copies the marked range of the current file into the global
variable -vveddump-. The text can be copied back into the same or
another file with the command:

    <ENTER> y
or, equivalently,
    <ENTER> yank

These yank commands insert the text in the current file starting on the
line following the current line. All subsequent text is shifted further
along the file.


<ENTER> t

This command is used to transcribe (i.e. copy) the marked range in the
current VED buffer to a position after the current line containing the
cursor. It is equivalent to
    <ENTER> copy
followed by
    <ENTER> y

<ENTER> ti
<ENTER> ti <file>

This "transcribe in" command is used to transcribe (i.e. copy) text in a
marked range from another file into the current file. Without an
argument it uses the last file edited before the current one.

<ENTER> to
<ENTER> to <file>

This "transcribe out" command is used to transcribe (i.e. copy) text
from the marked range in the current file into another file into the
current file. Without an argument it uses the last file edited before
the current one.

HELP * MARK, HELP * YANK, HELP * INOROUT.
HELP * VEDCOMMS gives an overview of VED commands.

-- Copying Files ------------------------------------------------------

For VMS USERS:
The DCL $COPY command can be used to make a copy of a file, e.g.
    $COPY <file1> <file2>

For UNIX USERS:
The Shell or CSHELL command 'cp' can be invoked to copy files, e.g.
    $ cp <file1> <file2>

If you want to use 'CSHELL' file name formats, use '%' instead of '$'.

-- The POP-11 procedure COPY ------------------------------------------

COPY(item)-> item

This procedure returns a copy of the data structure given to it as
argument. The structure is copied only at the top level - its components
are not copied. Thus if applied to a list, it will only copy the first
link. See HELP * COPYLIST and * COPYTREE for full copying of lists.

COPY can be applied to PROCESS records. If applied to a currently active
process record, the copy will be the state at the time of the last call
of RUNPROC (or RESUME etc) and NOT the current state. Running a process
record has no effect on a copy of that process.
