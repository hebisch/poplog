COUNTITEM                                                Aaron Sloman Feb 1982

This procedure takes a file name and counts the number of text items in the
file. It assumes characters form a text item unless separated by a space tab
or newline. Consequently it does not count FOO(X) as four items, the way
POP11 would. If the file name is given in word quotes, the file is assumed to
be a program file, and '.p' is added. Otherwise use string quotes.

E.g. to find out the number of items in file PHOO.P
        countitem("phoo") =>
or
        countitem('phoo.p') =>

If its a text file called REPORT, type
        countitem('report') =>
