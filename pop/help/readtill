HELP READTILL                                        A. Sloman May 1982

    readtill(item, or list of items);

Items are read in from the current input stream, i.e. *PROGLIST until
something is read in which is the argument to READTILL or an element of the
list given to READTILL.  Items are read using READITEM, so macros are not
expanded.  Items read in are left on the stack.

E.g.

    readtill(";") =>
    cat 99 ;
    ** cat 99 ;

    readtill([a b c]) =>
    cat 66 'a b c' b
    ** cat 66 a b c b

    [%readtill(".")%] =>
    This is a sentence.
    ** [This is a sentence .]
