HELP QUITIF                                       A. Sloman, June 1986

    quitif(<expression>)

translates to:

    if <expression> then quitloop endif;

This causes control to pass out of a loop enclosing this instruction (in
the same procedure only). The parentheses surrounding the expression are
essential.

To quit the Nth enclosing loop do:

    quitif(<expression>)(N)

The integer N cannot be replaced by a variable.
