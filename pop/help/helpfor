HELP HELPFOR                                     John Williams, Nov 1990

    <ENTER> helpfor <word>
    helpfor <word>

This command searches through POPLOG's documentation directories for
files which include <word> in their name. The list of matching file
names is displayed in a temporary VED buffer.

For example, the command

    <ENTER> helpfor help

will produce the following list of files:

    HELP * HELP
    HELP * HELPFILES
    HELP * HELPFOR
    HELP * PLOGHELP

You can then use <ESC> n and <ESC> h to read any files that look
interesting. (For more on these key sequences, see HELP * HELP).

Note: LIB * VED_HELPFOR first looks for HELP files belonging to the
current subsystem (e.g. POP-11, LISP etc). If no matching files are
found, it then searches the main POP-11 HELP directory.


Using wild-cards (*)
--------------------

If the argument ends with a '*', e.g.

    <ENTER> helpfor word*

then a list of all documentation filenames starting with 'word' will be
displayed (HELP WORDCOUNT, WORDQUOTE, WORDS, etc).

If the argument begins with a '*', e.g.

    <ENTER> helpfor *word

then a list of all documentation filenames ending with 'word' will be
displayed (HELP DATAWORD, ISWORD, etc).

The commands

    <ENTER> helpfor word
    <ENTER> helpfor *word*

are equivalent.

At present an asterisk may not be used anywhere except at the beginning
and/or end of the word.


Related commands
----------------

The command <ENTER> ?? may be used to find all the REF file entries that
match a given word.  See HELP * QUERY.

The command

    <ENTER> h <word>

also lists HELP files with names similar to <word>. It uses a 'spelling
correction' algorithm. In future versions of Poplog, this algorithm will
be incorporated in LIB VED_HELPFOR, making LIB * VED_H redundant.

You can list the names of library files that include a given word using

    <ENTER> showlibs <word>

See HELP * SHOWLIBS.
