HELP Xdefaults                                    Aaron Sloman July 2003

The libraries

    LIB VEDXVEDKEYS
    LIB VEDXTERMKEYS

were both substantially revamped in July 2003 and made more consistent
with each other, as described in

    HELP XVEDKEYS
        Key bindings for XVed

    HELP VEDXTERMKEYS
        Key bindings for the 'Dumb terminal' version of
        X running in an Xterm window

However for some of the function keys on a typical PC keyboard to be
properly distinguished when used in an Xterm window it is necessary to
use the following settings in either the user's .Xdefaults file or in
a system wide file, such as:  /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults/XTerm


    ! xterm translations to make VED work
    XTerm*VT100*Translations: #override \
        <Key>KP_0: string(0x1b) string("Op") \n\
        <Key>KP_Insert: string(0x1b) string("Op") \n\
        <Key>KP_Decimal: string(0x1b) string("On") \n\
        <Key>KP_Delete: string(0x1b) string("On") \n\
        <Key>KP_Home: string(0x1b) string("Ow") \n\
        <Key>KP_7: string(0x1b) string("Ow") \n\
        <Key>KP_Prior: string(0x1b) string("Oy") \n\
        <Key>KP_9: string(0x1b) string("Oy") \n\
        <Key>KP_Next: string(0x1b) string("Os") \n\
        <Key>KP_1: string(0x1b) string("Oq") \n\
        <Key>KP_End: string(0x1b) string("Oq") \n\
        <Key>KP_3: string(0x1b) string("Os")

    ! Make delete key transmit delete character
    XTerm*deleteIsDEL: true
