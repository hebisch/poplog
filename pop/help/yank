HELP YANK                                        A. Sloman June 1982

This assumes you know about marking a range of text. For more
information see HELP * MARK.

The VED command:

    <ENTER> y

copies into the current file, after the current line, the contents of
VVEDDUMP. This will normally be a list of the last lot of lines deleted
using the <ENTER> D command (delete marked range), or the <ENTER> DA
command (delete and append to VVEDDUMP) or the <ENTER> COPY command,
which copies the marked range into VVEDDUMP.  See HELP * COPY So the
sequence ENTER COPY, then move to another file, then <ENTER> YANK can be
used to transfer a copy of a marked portion of one file to another file.

<ENTER> T, is equivalent to <ENTER> COPY then ENTER Y, so it will make a
copy in the current file of the marked range.

--- <ENTER> yankl ----------------------------------------------------

This will restore after the current line, the last line deleted with the
delete line key, or by an explicit call of the procedure
VEDLINEDELETE(). This procedure stores the line deleted in the variable
VVEDLINEDUMP.

--- <ENTER> yankw ----------------------------------------------------

This will restore, where the cursor is, the last word, or portion of a
line deleted by either one of the delete word keys, or the delete line
to left or right keys. These keys (or rather the corresponding
procedures) put the portion of the line deleted into VVEDWORDDUMP.

--- <ENTER> splice ---------------------------------------------------

This is used in conjunction with VED_CUT, which removes the text between
the last two locations stored in vedpositionstack (using
vedpositionpush, or the corresponding VED key). ENTER CUT deletes then
copies the text into VVEDCUT_DUMP. Enter SPLICE then inserts it where
the cursor happens to be. See HELP * INOROUT for information on moving
ranges between files easily.
