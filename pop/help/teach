HELP TEACH                                         John Williams, May 1989

teach is a special command for looking at TEACH files. It can be invoked
from inside the editor with the command:

    <ENTER> teach name

and from outside the editor with:

    teach name

The TEACH files contain tutorial style descriptions of Poplog features
and some AI topics.

Complete beginners should read TEACH * TEACH.
