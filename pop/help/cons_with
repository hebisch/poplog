HELP CONS_WITH                           Revised: Adrian Howard Mar 1992

    cons_with CONS_P { .... }

-cons_with- allows the vector brackets "{" and "}" to be used to
construct other objects. CONS_P should be of the general form:

    CONS_P(ITEM_1, ITEM_2, ..., ITEM_N, N) -> NEW_ITEM

All vector construction procedures (-consstring-, -consvector-, etc)
have this general format and can be used with -cons_with-.

The items within the "{" and "}" brackets are passed to CONS_P along
with a count of the number of the items between the brackets. For
example:

    cons_with consstring {`c` `a` `t`}=>
    ** cat

    cons_with consintvec {1 2 3}=>
    ** <intvec 1 2 3>

    cons_with conslist {%1, 2, 3%}=>
    ** [1 2 3]
