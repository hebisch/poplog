    syssort(list, predicate)
    syssort(list, boolean, predicate)

The first argument is a list, the last argument a procedure which takes
two items and returns a boolean result. If E1 and E2 are elements of the
list and

        predicate(E1,E2)

is not FALSE, then E1 will not come after E2 in the sorted list.

If the optional boolean argument is FALSE, then the sort is non-copying,
and merely re-arranges the argument list, cf * NCREV.

The procedure * SORT uses * ALPHABEFORE as the predicate if the list
contains words or strings, and uses < if it contains numbers.

SYSSORT uses a merge sort algorithm. See SHOWLIB * SYSSORT.
