HELP SAVEPROC                               Steven Hardy, March 1982

This procedure is used to save the state of the current process. It
returns a process record which, when activated, will 'return' from the
call of SAVEPROC with FALSE as its result.

More explicitly, an updated copy of the current processes record is made
with a FALSE added to the user stack.

See HELP * PROCESS.
