HELP VT52                                                   A.Sloman Feb 1983


                 Using VED with a VT52 Compatible Terminal
                 =========================================

The command:
    LIB VT52;

will compile a file which sets up VED for a VT52 terminal. This command can
be put in your VEDINIT.P file if you regularly use a VT52.

There may be a saved image which can be run with the DCL command:
    $ POP11/VT52

Definition of 'DUMB VT52' terminal:
    no insert line,
    no delete line,
    no character insert,
    no character delete,
    no graphic characters,
    no special functions on numeric keypad,
    only three function keys GOLD KEY2 KEY3
        (There may be more function keys on some VDUs.)

                Mapping between characters and procedures
                =========================================
Control characters are mostly mapped onto edit functions. See HELP VEDKEYS

The GOLD key plays a special role, usually preceding another key. Similarly
    the <ESC> key.

Press GOLD twice to refresh the screen, in case it has got corrupted, e.g. by
broadcast messages.

--------------
The four arrow keys move the cursor one space in the direction of the
    arrow.
