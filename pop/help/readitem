READITEM is a procedure which, when called, returns the next item from
*PROGLIST, and removes it from there. Word items which are macros are NOT
expanded, neither is any autoloading tried.

READITEM is useful for reading in text items which are not to be interpreted
as program code. For instance it is used by *READLINE to read in items from
the terminal.

For further information on input/output procedures, see REF *SYSIO.
