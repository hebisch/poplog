HELP SYSOBEY (Unix version)                      A. Sloman, Dec 1983

    sysobey(<string>)
or
    sysobey(<string>,<ascii_code>)
or
    sysobey(<file>,<argument_list>)

In the first two formats, the <string> is run as a SHELL command, by
setting up a child process (using SYSVFORK). The <ascii_code> controls
which shell is used;

- If the <ascii_code> is that for the character `%` then /bin/csh is
    used

- If it is `!` then the value of the environment variable SHELL is used

- If there is no argument or `$` is given then /bin/sh is run

In the third format <file> should be an executable file, and is run by
setting up a child process (again using SYSVFORK). The argument strings in
<argument_list> are given to *SYSEXECUTE, which executes the file. While
the child process is running, SYSOBEY waits, using SYSWAIT, which returns
the child's Process IDentification number when it is dead.
