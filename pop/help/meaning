HELP MEANING                                    Steven Hardy, March 1982

This identifier is obsolete and the corresponding procedure has been
withdrawn.

Anyone wishing to use it can do something like

    define meaning =
        newproperty([], 100, undef, true)
    enddefine;

This will define a procedure which takes one argument which can be
anything, and returns one result. The default result is UNDEF.  However,
-meaning- will have an updater, which can be used to change the result
for future use.

    meaning("cat") =>
    ** undef

    "noun" -> meaning("cat");
    meaning("cat") =>
    ** noun

    [noun animal vertebrate] -> meaning("cat");
    ...

    meaning(999) =>
    ** undef
