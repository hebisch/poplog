HELP NEWLINE                                Revised by Fran Evelyn, July 85

The value of this variable is a word containing the newline (or
linefeed) character. For example

    pr(newline);

causes the cursor to move to the next line, as the following examples show:

    pr("silly"); pr("billy");
    sillybilly

    pr("silly"); pr(newline); pr("billy");
    silly
    billy
