HELP BYE                                       Aaron Sloman, August 1993

In order to leave VED and Poplog you can give the command

    ENTER bye RETURN

this will write all changed files that are writeable and have not been
saved to disk, and then will leave VED and terminate the current Poplog
sesssion.

In order to leave Poplog you can also type

    bye

followed by pressing the return key, if you are typing to the Pop-11
prompt, but not inside the editor.
