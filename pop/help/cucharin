CUCHARIN                                 updated Mark Rubinstein  October 1985

Contains the character repeater which is currently being used as input by
COMPILE - although this variable is user assignable there is no point in
changing it since after setting up PROGLIST the compiler never uses CUCHARIN
again.

During normal interaction with the terminal, CUCHARIN will be CHARIN. While
a file is being compiled, CUCHARIN will be the character repeater for the
file, usually produced by DISCIN. See HELP * DISCIN.
