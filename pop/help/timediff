    timediff() -> SECS

This procedure returns the CPU time in seconds since its previous use.
The first time it is called the result is meaningless. Use it before and
after testing the time take for some operation.

The returned value refers to the amount of time spent within POPLOG. It
does not refer to "real" time and is not effected by any other processes
running on your machine
