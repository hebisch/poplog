    sysclose(<device record>)

This procedure closes a *DEVICE. Note that this is usually unnecessary as all
garbage-collected device records are closed automatically, as are all devices
on system exit.

If a file is created using *DISCOUT then it will be closed if you try to
output *TERMIN to it. This is the easiest way to close a file opened for
printing.

If a file is opened for reading, using *DISCIN, it will be closed when you
have read to the end, i.e. after TERMIN is produced.

For more information on Input/Output procedures see REF SYSIO.
