    current_section -> SECT

-current_section- is an active variable which holds the current section
record SECT. The current section can be changed by assigning another
section to -current_section- like this:

    SECT -> current_section

The initial value of -current_section- is the top-level section record
-pop_section- (see HELP *POP_SECTION); this outputs as follows:

    current_section =>
    ** <section>
