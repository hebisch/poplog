HELP POPPROCS                                    John Williams, Feb 1991

Prior to POPLOG Version 14, this file contained a list of all POPLOG's
built-in procedures. However, the POPLOG system has grown so much that
this is no longer practical.

The following files overview documentation of built-in procedures and
variables:

    REF * REFFILES
    HELP * HELPFILES
    HELP * LIBFILES
    HELP * POPVARS

The *QUERY mechanism can be used to obtain information on most built-in
identifiers.
