    subscrw(INT, WORD) -> CHAR

This procedure is used to access individual characters in a word. The
integer INT specifies which character is required, and the result is
returned in the form of the *ASCII code for that character. For example:

    subscrw(1, "zebra") =>
    ** 122

    subscrw(6, "syntax") =>
    ** 120

(122 is the ASCII code for `z`, and 120 the code for `x`).

Since -subscrw- is the -class_apply- of words (see REF *KEYS) the above
could also be written as:

    "zebra"(1)=>
    ** 122

    "syntax"(6)=>
    ** 120
