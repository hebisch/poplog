HELP POPDEVERR                                  Revised by Fran Evelyn, July 85

    popdeverr -> device

POPDEVERR is an active variable which holds the device for the standard error
channel (written to by *CHARERR). Assigning to it,

    <device> -> popdeverr

enables a new device to be assigned to the standard channel, and can be used
along with updating POPDEVIN and POPDEVERR to redirect standard I/O after
SYSFORKing a child process, and before SYSEXECUTEing a new image.
