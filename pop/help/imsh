HELP IMSH                                       A.Sloman Aug 1986

VED <ENTER> IMSH

This VED command creates a SHELL process (running/bin/sh) and a VED
window that is used for communication with the shell process in
"immediate mode". Shell commands given in that window will be executed
by the process and any output will be printed into the ved buffer for
the window. The results can be edited normally except that pressing
<RETURN> will always be interpreted as meaning
    'Give this line as a command to the shell process'

This facility is analogous to <ENTER> IMCSH, which runs a CSH process,
and it has the same limitations. Neither can be used to run interactive
programs like mail.
