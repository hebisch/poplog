HELP DATASTRUCTURES                            updated A.Sloman Jan 1986

There are several types of datastructures in POP-11 (types of object
that your program can manipulate). Each type is associated with a
'dataword' and a class structure called a key. HELP files available
include:
    * ARRAYS          - Multidimensional structures indexed by numbers
    * BOOLEAN         - TRUE or FALSE
    * CLASSES         - Keys and Classes - an overview
    * DATAWORD        - Returns the dataword of its argument.
    * DEVICE          - I/O Devices
    * MORELISTS       - Summary of list manipulating procedures
    * NIL             - The unique item in NIL.
    * NUMBERS         - There are various kinds of numbers
    * PAIR            - Pair (and LISTS)
    * PROCASDATA      - Procedure (This includes CLOSURES, PROPERTIES, ARRAYS)
    * PROCESS         - Processes which save the state of a computation
    * PROPERTIES      - Generalised association tables
    * REFERENCES      - References - one-element records
    * SECTIONS        - Structures with information for the compiler
    * STRINGS         - Strings
    * TERMIN          - The unique item in TERMIN.
    * VECTORS         - Vectors
    * WORDS           - Words
Some procedures work on many classes of datastructures:
    * DATAPROCS
For more on datastructures see
    * CLASSES       - information on user defined classes
    * VECTORCLASS   - defining new sorts of vectors
    * RECORDCLASS   - defining new sorts of records
