HELP MOVED_TO_TEACHING                            Aaron Sloman, Jan 2005

The following old HELP files have been moved to the TEACHING package
HELP directory

    $usepop/pop/packages/teaching/help/

They can be made accessible via the command:

    uses teaching;

Other related files can be found in the teach, auto and lib directories
of
    $usepop/pop/packages/teaching/


HELP files moved:

    analogy
    evans
    grammar
    logic
    logic.exp
    logic.hlp
    morelists
    newobj
    oldlisp
    planet
    readpicture
    recursion
    scheck
    schema
    seepicture
    someschema
    storepicture
    tree_identify
    turtle
    turtlesum
    vcalc


The following files probably should be moved to a home for obsolete
files
    con80x25keys
    (perhaps others)
