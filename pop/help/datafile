The procedure datafile allows certain Pop-11 data structures to be
recorded on disk, and subsequently read back.


To write a structure to disk, use:

    struct -> datafile(filename);

Similarly, to read a structure back from disk, use:

    datafile(filename) -> struct;

The permitted datatypes are:

    Words, numbers, lists, vector types, record types, arrays,
    ordinary properties, booleans, named procedures, closures of named
    procedures.

Since arrays can be organised by row or by column, that information
about an array is stored by the updater of datafile and restored when
datafile recreates the array from a stored version.
