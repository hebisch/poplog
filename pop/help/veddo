HELP VEDDO                                        A. Sloman June 1982

    veddo(string);
    veddo(string, place_on_status_line);

The string is a command which could have been typed on the command like.
VEDDO will execute it.  For example to globally substitue 'fish' for
'fried':

    veddo('gs/fried/fish');

You can also pass veddo an optional boolean argument stating if the
command should be placed on the command line (using -vedputcommand-).
This will let users type the <REDO> key to perform the command again.
So:

    veddo('/fish', true);

Will place '/fish' on the command line and then perform the command.
