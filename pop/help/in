HELP IN                                                     A. Sloman, April 85

IN is used in one form of the FOR statement, viz:

    for <variable> in <expression> do <actions> endfor

This evaluates the expression, which should yield a list, and then performs
<actions> with the variable being successively bound to each element of the
list, for example:

    for x in [a b c] do x => endfor;
    ** a
    ** b
    ** c
