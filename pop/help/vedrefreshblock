HELP VEDREFRESHBLOCK                                   A.Sloman May 1987

Refreshing an arbitrary rectangular block of text in a VED window.

  vedrefreshblock(<int:L1>,<int:C1>,<int:L2>,<int:C2>,<bool:dotail>)

Keywords: VED refresh block

L1,C2 represent a line and column in the VED buffer, as do L2,C2.
The two positions are taken as opposite corners of a rectangular block
of text to be refreshed.

If dotail is non-false, then visible text to the right of the block will
also be refreshed.

Since the first four arguments are taken to be any two opposite corners
of the block the following combinations are all equivalent:

    L1 C1 L2 C2;  L1 C2 L2 C1; L2 C2 L1 C1; L2 C1 L1 C2

This procedure is useful for packages that implement windows occupying
arbitrary rectangular portions of the screen, and for programs that
insert or delete blocks of text which are not made of complete lines.

It does not do anything about the indication of marked range on the left
of the screen, as vedrefreshrange does.
