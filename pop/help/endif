HELP ENDIF                                            Steven Hardy, March 1982

This marks the end of an IF statement which takes the form:

    if <condition>
        then <consequent>
    elseif <condition>
        then <consequent>
            <+ any number of additional ELSEIF...THEN.... clauses>
    else
        <consequent>
    endif

The 'ELSE <consequent>' can be omitted if desired. The 'ELSEIF <condition>
THEN <consequent>' can be either omitted or repeated as many times as
required.  A condition is any expression and a consequent is any sequence
of POP11 statements.
