HELP VED_WIGGLE                                  John Williams, Nov 1986

 <ENTER> wiggle opening-bracket closing-bracket

    e.g     <ENTER> wiggle  []
    e.g     <ENTER> wiggle  ()

This command makes the cursor automatically wiggle over the matching
opening-bracket whenever closing-bracket is typed in a file of the same
type (i.e. the same file extension) as the current file.

If closing-bracket is already a `wiggly' character, then this command
will restore its normal behaviour.

If the command <ENTER> wiggle is given with no arguments, then all
automatic wiggling is stopped, until the <ENTER> wiggle command
is given again.

If you want to define some wiggly closing bracket characters in your
"vedinit.p" file, use:

    vedsetwiggle(closing-bracket, filetype)

inside a *ved_runtime_action, as in the following example:

    define ved_runtime_action;
        vedsetwiggle(`]`, '.p')
    enddefine;

which sets up "]" as a wiggling character in '.p' files.
