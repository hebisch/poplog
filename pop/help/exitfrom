HELP EXITFROM                                  Ros Barrett, January 1986

    exitfrom(<procedure | call stack length>)

EXITFROM takes one argument, either a procedure higher up in the calling
stack than the caller, or an integer representing a call stack length as
returned by *CALLSTACKLENGTH. Control leaves the caller immediately
EXITFROM is called. Instructions in the caller and the called procedure,
and instructions in procedures in the calling stack in between the two,
are never finished. If the first argument is an integer, exiting
terminates when the call stack length is equal to or less than the
integer. Values of variables which are local to procedures in between
the caller of EXITFROM and the procedure control returns to, are reset
appropriately.
