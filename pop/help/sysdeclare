HELP SYSDECLARE                        Revised by Fran Evelyn, July 85

    sysdeclare(<word>)

SYSDECLARE takes a word as argument and declares the word as an ordinary
variable. If the variable has not already been declared, the value of
* PRWARNING is applied to the word. The result of this is that a message
is printed on the screen, warning the user that the word is being
declared as a variable. The value of PRWARNING can be changed by the
user to alter the form of warning messages. The default value of
PRWARNING is the procedure * SYSPRWARNING, which prints a message in the
following format:

    ;;; DECLARING VARIABLE foo

See REF *VMCODE for full details of POPLOG Virtual Machine procedures.
