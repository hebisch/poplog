HELP APOSTROPHE                                     Steven Hardy, March 1982

Apostrophes have a special significance in POP-11. The character ' is used
to delimit strings, for example

    'this is a string'

The character ` is used to indicate 'character constants', for example:

    `a`     (a character constant)

See REF *ITEMISE for details of itemisation in POP-11, and TEACH *APOSTROPHE
for a tutorial introduction to the use of apostrophes.
