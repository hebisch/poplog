HELP VED_NEXTSAME                                     Aaron Sloman May 1991

ENTER nextsame
ENTER nextsame <number>

This library program (LIB * VED_NEXTSAME) enables you to compare two
files in VED to find where they next have a common line. If used in
conjunction with LIB * VED_DIFF it enables similarities and differences
to be explored easily.

With two files in VED, one a modified version of the other, and with the
cursor at a point in each where they differ, use

    ENTER nextsame

to find the next good point at which to start again looking for
differences.

It then makes 'nextdiff' the next command, so you need only press REDO to
continue searching for differences.


If it is ambiguous where the next common line should be ved_nextsame
will not necessarily make the best choice. But it seems to be useful
more often than not.


GLOBAL VARIABLES

ved_nextsame_limit

    The variable ved_nextsame_limit should have an integer value. It
    determines how far to search down each file to find a common line.
    Default = 60 lines.

    If you provide a numerical argument to ved_nextsame, you can change
    the limit. E.g.
        ENTER nextsame 25

    will set the limit to be 25 lines, and will do the search.


ved_nextsame_dot

    This variable should have a boolean value. If true, it accepts lines
    that start with a dot as candidates for being the same. If false
    then lines starting with a dot are ignored (for use with nroff and
    troff. The default is FALSE. I.e. lines starting with `.` are
    ignored.
