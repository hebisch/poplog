"boolean" is the -dataword- (see HELP *DATAWORD) of the POP-11 objects
which are the values of the variables -true- and -false-. These values
(printed as <true> and <false>) are called "boolean" values (after
George Boole who invented symbolic logic). An expression which evaluates
to a boolean value is a boolean expression.
