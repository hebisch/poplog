HELP POPARGLIST                                 Steven Hardy, March 1982

POPARGLIST is a variable containing a list of the arguments with which
the POP system was invoked, with each argument in the form of a string.
When the POP system is invoked with arguments, it assumes that the first
argument is the name of a file to compile, or, if the name begins with a
"-" (UNIX) or "/" (VMS), to restore. The remaining arguments are placed
in POPARGLIST.
