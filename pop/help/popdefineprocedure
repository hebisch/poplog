This facility is obsolete for the same reason as -popconstruct-. See
HELP * POPCONSTRUCT. There is an autoloadbale version in the library,
for the sake of backward compatibility.

    <boolean> -> popdefineprocedure;

This variable is local to POP11_COMP_STREAM, and is user-assignable. If
its value is  FALSE  (the  default)  then   identifiers  created  by
*DEFINE  are automatically declared to  be of unrestricted type. If it
is TRUE (i.e. non-false) they are declared as "procedure" type
identifiers.

Since it is local to the compiler, it cannot usefully be assigned to in
the users 'init.p' by an ordinary assignment. To change its global
default value in 'init.p' use set_global_valof, e.g.
    set_global_valof(true, "popdefineprocedure");

A similar strategy may be used for POPDEFINECONSTANT

The interpretation of these variables is determined by a user-definable
procedure POP11_DEFINE_DECLARE, described in REF * POPCOMPILE.
