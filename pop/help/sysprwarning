    sysprwarning(<word>);

This procedure is the initial value of the variable PRWARNING (which may
be altered by the user who wishes to change the style of warning
messages). This procedure takes a word as argument, and uses
SYSPRMESSAGE to print a warning message to indicate that the word is
being declared as a variable, e.g.

    sysprwarning("foo");

    ;;; DECLARING VARIABLE foo

If the variable POPWARNINGS does not have the value FALSE, then its value is
assumed to be a list, and the newly declared identifier is added to the list.
To suppress this do

    false -> popwarnings;
