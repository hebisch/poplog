HELP SRC                                         John Williams, Jan 1991

SRC is a *MACRO for looking at system source code files. It can be
invoked from inside the editor with the command

    <ENTER> src <filename>

and from outside the editor with

    src <filename>

The POP-11 source files are generally NOT supplied with Poplog, so this
command is only useful for examining Lisp, Prolog, or PML source code.
