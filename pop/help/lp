HELP LP                                          John Williams, Apr 1989

    <ENTER> lp [-<flags>] [<filenames>]
    <ENTER> lpmr [-<flags>]

<ENTER> LP provides a Ved interface to the Unix lp command, for printing
files.

If you are unfamiliar with lp, you should read MAN * LP.

<ENTER> LP is exactly like the Unix lp, except that if no <filenames>
are specified, the contents of the current Ved buffer are sent to the
printer. So, for example, to print this file on a printer called "tpb",
do:

    <ENTER> lp -d tpb <RETURN>

You can also print marked portions of files, using <ENTER> LPMR. For
example, the command

    <ENTER> lpmr -d tpb

will send the marked portion of the current file to the printer "tpb".
