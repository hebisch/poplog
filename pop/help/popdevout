HELP POPDEVOUT                                  Revised by Fran Evelyn, July 85

    popdevout -> device

POPDEVOUT is an active variable which holds the device for the standard output
channel (written to by *CHAROUT). Assigning to it,

    <device> -> popdevout

enables a new device to be assigned to the standard channel, and can be used
along with the updaters of POPDEVIN and POPDEVERR to redirect standard I/O
after SYSFORKing a child process, and before SYSEXECUTEing a new image.
