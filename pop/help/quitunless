HELP QUITUNLESS                                 Aaron Sloman, June 1982

    quitunless(<expression>)

translates to:

    unless <expression> then quitloop endunless;

This causes control to pass out of a loop enclosing this instruction (in
the same procedure only). The parentheses surrounding the expression are
essential.

To quit the Nth enclosing loop do

    quitunless(<expression>)(N)

The integer N cannot be replaced by a variable.
