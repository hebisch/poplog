HELP TIMES                                      Revised by Fran Evelyn, July 85

This is used in one form of the REPEAT statement, viz:

    repeat <number> times <actions> endrepeat;

This causes the <actions> to be performed the appropriate <number> of times.
For example:

    repeat 3 times [a b c] => endrepeat;

will produce the output

    ** [a b c]
    ** [a b c]
    ** [a b c]
