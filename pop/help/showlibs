HELP SHOWLIBS                                    John Williams, Nov 1991

    <ENTER> showlibs <word>

This command searches through the POP-11 library directories listed in
*POPUSESLIST for library files which include <word> in their name. The
list of matching library names is displayed in a temporary VED buffer.

For example, the command

    <ENTER> showlibs proc

will produce the following list of library files:

    LIB * CONSPROCTO.P
    LIB * DEADPROC.P
    LIB * EXTERNAL_PTR_TO_PROCEDURE.P
    LIB * ISEXTERNAL_PROCEDURE.P
    LIB * ISLIVE_EXTERNAL_PROCEDURE.P
    LIB * POPDEFINEPROCEDURE.P
    LIB * SLOWPROCS.P
    LIB * VED_PROCNET.P
    LIB * VEDKEYPROC.P

You can then use <ESC> N and <ESC> H to examine any files that look
interesting. (For more on these key sequences, see HELP * HELP).

Note: LIB * VED_SHOWLIBS first looks for library files belonging to the
current subsystem (e.g. POP-11, LISP etc). If none are found, it then
searches the POP-11 library directories in *POPUSESLIST.


Using wild-cards (*)
--------------------

If the argument ends with a '*', e.g.

    <ENTER> showlibs word*

then a list of libraries whose names start with 'word' will be displayed
(LIB WORDCOUNT.P, WORDSWITH.P, etc).

If the argument begins with a '*', e.g.

    <ENTER> showlibs *word.p        (don't forget the .p suffix!)

then a list of libraries whose names end with 'word' will be displayed
(LIB KEY_OF_DATAWORD.P, LIB VEDCAPWORD.P, etc).

The commands

    <ENTER> showlibs word
    <ENTER> showlibs *word*

are equivalent.

At present an asterisk may not be used anywhere except at the beginning
and/or end of the word.
