IF STATEMENTS

When an IF statement is executed, the condition (which follows *IF) is
first evaluated, and if the result is TRUE then the action (the part
which follows *THEN) is also executed. What action to take if the
condition is not true is determined by other clauses that can be
inserted into the statement preceded by *ELSEIF or *ELSE. An IF
statement thus takes the form:

    if <condition>
        then <action>
    elseif <condition>
        then <action>
    <any number of additional ELSEIF...THEN.... clauses>
    else
        <action>
    endif
