HELP ASSIGN                                         Steven Hardy, March 1982

The assignment arrow, ->, tells POP-11 to store the item from the top of
the stack in the variable which follows it. The item is also removed from
the stack. If followed by a procedure call, the  assignment arrow indicates
that the *UPDATER of the procedure is to be applied.

Normally, the assignment arrow is preceded by an expression though this is
not necessary.
