HELP ITEMREAD                                         Steven Hardy  January 78

    itemread() -> item

This procedure (of no arguments) reads an item from the input stream (one of
its main uses is in macro definitions). For example:

    itemread() -> x;
    hithere
    x =>
    ** hithere

ITEMREAD expands macros (see MACRO). * READITEM doesn't expand macros.

If a word read by ITEMREAD has IDENTPROPS equal to UNDEF then there is a
possibility that it might be a macro which should be auto-loaded from the
library.  ITEMREAD checks for this possibility.
