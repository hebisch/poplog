HELP PROLOGLIBLIST                              Robert Duncan, July 1993

    uses prologliblist;

The variable prologliblist contains a list of the library directories
searched by the Prolog subsystem, e.g when responding to *SHOWLIB
commands. The variable is always defined when the Prolog subsystem is
loaded, or you can use LIB * PROLOGLIBLIST to define it within Pop-11.

If you want to view Prolog libraries from Pop-11 you can use the
command:

    <ENTER> prolog showlib <library-name>
