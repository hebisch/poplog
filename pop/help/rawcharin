    rawcharin() -> <character>;

This procedure reads a character from the terminal via the device *POPDEVRAW.
It does not prompt or echo. Every character is a 'break' character, and is
returned immediately it is typed. Additionally, if any characters have been
output by *RAWCHAROUT and not yet printed, a call of RAWCHARIN will cause them
to be sent to the terminal.

RAWCHARIN is used by *VEDINASCII, the VED character repeater.
