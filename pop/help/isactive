HELP ISACTIVE                                      John Gibson June 1987

    isactive(<word or identifier>) -> <multiplicity or false>

ISACTIVE can be  used to determine  if an identifier  is declared as  an
active variable: it returns  false if the identifier  is not active,  or
the active multiplicity if it is  (where the multiplicity is an  integer
in the range 0 - 255). If  the argument is a word, ISACTIVE returns  the
same information for any permanent identifier currently associated  with
the word (or false if there isn't one).

    See also HELP *ACTIVE_VARIABLES, REF *IDENT.
