HELP RAWCHAROUT                                     A. Sloman, July 1990

    rawcharout(<character|string>)

RAWCHAROUT takes a character code or string as argument and sends the
character, or the characters in the string, to the terminal, using the
device *POPRAWDEVOUT.

Output is buffered. That is characters will not actually be sent until
the buffer (size 128 or greater) is full, or a null character is output
(RAWCHAROUT(0)), or either

    sysflush(poprawdevout);
or
    rawcharin();

is executed.

VED previously used -vedoutascii- for all output to the screen. Now that
-rawcharout- accepts strings it can be used directly, and -vedoutascii-
is therefore redundant.
