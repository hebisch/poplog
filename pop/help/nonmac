HELP NONMAC                                         Steven Hardy, March 1982

    nonmac <macro identifier>

If followed by a macro name, NONMAC stops the expansion of that macro. That
is, the macro will not be called and the name will be treated as an ordinary
identifier. For example, if SILLY is a macro then

    nonmac silly -> x;

will treat SILLY as an ordinary variable and assign the macro procedure SILLY
to X (which can then be used in calls of the procedure in place of SILLY).
