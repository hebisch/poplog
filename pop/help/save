    save(<filename>,<procedure>);

SAVE runs <procedure>, and any printout produced is saved in the file
<filename>. If <filename> is a word then '.p' will be added to it. If it
is a string, the name will remain unaltered.

SAVE is defined using *CUCHAROUT and *DISCOUT. To see how, type:

    showlib save
