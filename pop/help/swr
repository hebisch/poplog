HELP SWR                                             Steven Hardy, July 1982

The VED command ENTER SWR (Swap Word Right) swaps the word 'under' the cursor
with the word to its right. The cursor is left over the word so repeated use
of SWR moves the same word. A newline is counted as a word so SWR moves a
word at the end of a line to the beginning of the next line.

A 'word' is a sequence of characters not containing a space. If the cursor is
initially over a space the word to the right of the cursor is swapped with
the word to its right.
