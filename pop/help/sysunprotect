HELP SYSUNPROTECT                                            A.Sloman Jan 1982

    sysunprotect(word);

Normally it is not possible to trace or redefine a system procedure (for good
reasons).  However if you wish to do so SYSUNPROTECT can be applied to the
identifier to remove the protection.  Thereafter the procedure can be
re-defined, or traced (see HELP * TRACE).  However, tracing and the
new definition will apply only within user procedures compiled after the use
of SYSUNPROTECT. E.g. suppose you wish to trace HD, you can then do

    sysunprotect("hd");
    trace hd;

Then compile the procedures whose use of HD you wish to trace. Calls of HD
inside SYSTEM procedures will also be traced.

N.B. if you sysunprotect then redefine system procedures, you do so at your
own risk.
