HELP PR                                         Revised by Fran Evelyn, July 85

    pr(<item>)

PR is a variable which is used to hold a printing procedure, which in turn is
used by all procedures in the system which print things. It is user-
assignable. Its default value is the procedure *SYSPR, which prints items
using the procedure SYS_SYSPR, which in turn prints each class of object
according to a standard format.
