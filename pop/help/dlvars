HELP DLVARS                                      Adrian Howard, Sep 1992

    dlvars <word 1>, <word 2>, <word 3> = <initialisation>, ...;

The efficiency gain in using -lvars- is not always realised if the
procedure contains NESTED procedure definitions that use one or more of
the lexical variables non-locally. This is because the compiler may have
to make a new closure of the nested procedure every time the enclosing
procedure runs, causing considerable storage turn-over and garbage
collections. To overcome this such variables can be declared as a
lexically scoped dynamic variable using -dlvars-. For full information
see HELP *LVARS/Nested.
