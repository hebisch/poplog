HELP SYSSYNONYM                                         J. Gibson, July 1983

    syssynonym(<word1>, <word2>)

SYSSYNONYM associates <word1> with whatever identifier <word2> is currently
associated with. Thus afterwards the two words are synonymous as variables or
constants, e.g.

    vars x; 123 -> x;
    syssynonym("y", "x");

    y =>
    ** 123

    [a b c d] -> y;

    x =>
    ** [a b c d]
