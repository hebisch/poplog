HELP ISDYNAMIC                                              A. Sloman Dec 1983

    isdynamic(item) -> false or procedure

See REF * LISTS for information on lists and how they are represented.
See HELP *PDTOLIST on how to create a dynamic list from a generator procedure.

ISDYNAMIC can be used to check whether an object is a dynamic list. It takes
one argument and returns false if it is not a dynamic list, otherwise it
returns the generator procedure.

So a macro which needs to know whether *PROGLIST is a dynamic list or not can
do
    if isdynamic(proglist) then ...

EXPANDLIST is a procedure which expands dynamic lists and makes them
static.  See HELP * EXPANDLIST.
