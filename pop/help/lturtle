HELP LTURTLE                                 A. Sloman May 1982

LIB LTURTLE;
This command compiles a version of the TURTLE program (see HELP TURTLE).
The main difference is that instead of using an array for the picture, it
uses a list of lists. Instead of the command
                    DISPLAY();
use the command
                    PICTURE ==>

In this version, empty spaces in the picture are represented by ".".
Also, when the picture is printed out using ==>, increasing Y values go down
the screen, instead of up. Similarly, the TURN command now makes the turtle
turn clockwise rather than counter-clockwise.
