HELP SYSREPEAT                                      Mark Rubinstein  May 1985.

    sysrepeat(integer, procedure);

SYSREPEAT is a procedure for calling the "repeat" syntax, so that

    sysrepeat(5, vedcharup);

is equivalent to:

    repeat 5 times
        vedcharup()
    endrepeat;

SYSREPEAT could be defined as (see SHOWLIB * SYSREPEAT)

    define sysrepeat(number, action);
        repeat number times
            action();
        endrepeat;
    enddefine;

This can be useful if you want to make a closure of the procedure, for
example:

    vars charuptimes;
    sysrepeat(% vedcharup %) -> charuptimes;
