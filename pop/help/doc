DOC is a *MACRO for looking at system documentation files. It can be
invoked from inside the editor with the command

    <ENTER> doc <name>

and from outside the editor with

    doc <name>

The DOC files are primarily intended for printing out in the form of
manuals. Some contain formatting commands.
