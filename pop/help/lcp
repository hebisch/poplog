VED ENTER-LCP, or ESC C
This VED command allows you to load the 'current' procedure, i.e. the one the
cursor is in, without loading the rest of the file, and without having to
mark the procedure (as required by the VED ENTER-LMR command). To illustrate,
put the cursor somewhere in the following procedure definition, then give the
ENTER LCP command.

define sillything();
    [the procedure works] =>
enddefine;

N.B. LCP and ESC C assume that the beginning of the procedure starts at the
beginning of a line. Try putting some spaces in front of 'define' then do
ENTER LCP (or ESC C) again. You'll get an error message, including the code
'NDB'. You can get more information with the command HELP NDB.

You can now test the procedure. E.g. type, on a blank line:
    sillything();

then mark that line with the mark buttons. Then type CTRL-D (which is
equivalent to ENTER-LMR). The procedure will be executed and the printout
spliced into the file.

Instead of ENTER LCP you can press the ESC button then C to compile the
'current' procedure, i.e. the one enclosing the cursor. Change the above
procedure to print something different, then use ESC C, then test the
procedure.

For more details see TEACH * LMR.

Note that if you use nested procedure definitions LCP may sometimes be
confused. In that case mark the procedure explicitly, and use LMR (or CTRL-D).
