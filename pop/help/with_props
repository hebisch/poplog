HELP WITH_PROPS                                        A.Sloman Nov 1986

WITH_PROPS
is a syntax word that can be used to over-ride the default value for the
PDPROPS of a procedure defined using DEFINE, or an anonymous procedure
created using PROCEDURE ... ENDPROCEDURE

    define foo(x,y) -> z with_props false;
        ...
    enddefine

    procedure(x,y) -> z with_props foo;
        ...
    endprocedure

"with_props" follows immediately after the input and/or outputs of the
procedure; it can be followed by a single word, or number, which will
then be assigned to the PDPROPS. The word FALSE is taken to mean the
value FALSE.
