    enddefmethod;

The keywords DEFMETHOD .. ENDDEFMETHOD are used for defining methods
within a flavour definition.  They are only usable if you have the
flavours library loaded.  The optional type arguments allowed are "before"
and "after". In most other respects the syntax is the same as if you were
defining a procedure.

See TEACH * FLAVOURS for full details of the flavour package.
See also HELP * DEFAULT_METHOD.
