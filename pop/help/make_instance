HELP MAKE_INSTANCE                          Mark Rubinstein  September 1985

    make_instance([<flavour_name> <attribute> <value> ...]) -> <instance>

MAKE_INSTANCE is part of the FLAVOURS package.  See TEACH * FLAVOURS for
full details of the package.

MAKE_INSTANCE makes an instance of the named flavour (the first element of
the list provided as argument).  The rest of the list is of the form
<attribute-name> <value>.  You can have as many of these as you like. Once
the instance has been made, MAKE_INSTANCE checks to see if the instance
can respond to the message "initialise" and if so it sends the message
"initialise" with the rest of the list as argument.  The method initialise
in the vanilla flavour provided sets all the attributes to be the given
values.

The first element of the list may optinally be a flavour instead of the name
of a flavour, so the following are identical.

    make_instance([window ...]);
    make_instance([^window_flavour ...]);
