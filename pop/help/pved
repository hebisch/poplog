HELP PVED                                        John Williams, Feb 1989

    pved <filename>
    <ENTER> pved <filename>
    ved_pved()

These commands are exactly like

    ved <filename>
    <ENTER> ved <filename>
    ved_ved()

respectively, EXCEPT that they assign FALSE to * vedwriteable, so that
the file can be altered in VED without risk of accidentally overwriting
the original. Useful for examining files belonging to others that may
not be adequately protected.
