HELP ARRAYFILE                                      David Hogg, Jan 1989

LIB * ARRAYFILE allows arrays with a "byte-accessible" arrayvector (i.e.
arrays that are not based on full vectors) to be recorded on disk, and
subsequently read back.

To write an array to disk, do

    array -> arrayfile(filename);

e.g.

    newsarray([1 100 1 100]) -> arrayfile('temp');

To read an array from disk, do

    arrayfile(filename) -> array;

e.g.

    arrayfile('temp') =>
    ** <array [1 100 1 100]>

If you want to read data back into an existing array, to save memory
usage, do

    arrayfile(filename, array) -> array;

The contents of the argument array will be overwritten by the data on
disk. The array must have the same bounds and type as the array used to
write the file.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Files created by arrayfile may not be transferred
correctly between different machine architectures. The exception is
8-bit (string) arrays which should always be transferred correctly.
