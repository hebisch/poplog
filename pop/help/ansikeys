HELP ANSIKEYS                                    John Williams, Oct 1989

This file describes how to use VED on an Ansi standard terminal, for
example: the Telnet window of an NCD X terminal.

NB: TO READ MORE, TYPE CTRL-V (THE "SCREENDOWN" KEY) !!

Ansi standard terminals are assumed not to have function keys, cursor
control keys, or a special numeric keypad. All editing operations are
effected via VED's default set of Control and Escape key sequences,
described fully in HELP * VEDKEYS. For convenience, however, the most
vital key sequences are listed below.

    enter           CTRL-G
    refresh         CTRL-L

    charup          CTRL-P          screenup        esc-v
    chardown        CTRL-N          screendown      CTRL-V
    charleft        CTRL-B          screenleft      CTRL-A
    charright       CTRL-F          textright       CTRL-E

    marklo          esc-m
    markhi          esc-M

Note for Emacs users: the basic cursor movement keystrokes are the same.
