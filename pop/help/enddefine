HELP ENDDEFINE                                       Steven Hardy, March 1982

This marks the end of a procedure definition, which takes the form

    define <header-line>;
       <body>
    enddefine;

The header-line describes the type of the procedure, its arguments and
results. The body is any POP-11 code. It is also possible to create anonymous
procedures (see HELP *PROCEDURE).

See also HELP *DEFINE - for form and content of procedure definitions
