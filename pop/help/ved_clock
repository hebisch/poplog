LIB * VED_CLOCK

This utility allows VED to display the time on the current status line.


The available commands are:

ENTER clock
    To turn the clock display on and off

ENTER secs
    To turn display of seconds on and off. If it is off only hours and
    minutes are displayed.

ENTER clock <integer>
ENTER secs <integer>
    To assign the <integer> to be the time interval in seconds between
    updates of the clock.


In order to ensure that ved_clock always runs when you start VED you
can put the following in your vedinit.p file

        uses ved_clock
        ved_clock();
