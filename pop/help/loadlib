HELP LOADLIB                              Rosalind Barrett, January 1986

    loadlib(<word | string>);

The Pop11 procedure -loadlib- takes one argument, a word or a string.
-loadlib- turns the argument into a string and adds the suffix '.p' to
it if it was not provided. It then searches the directories in
POPUSESLIST for a library file of that name. It if finds one, it
compiles it. If the search fails -loadlib- produces the MISHAP message
"LIBRARY FILE NOT FOUND".

This procedure is useful if you are writing a program that will compile
libraries but you do not know at the time of writing what the particular
files will be.
