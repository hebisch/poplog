CLOSE
This is a now obsolete syntax word maintained for compatibility with
previous versions of POP-11 and POP-2. At one time conditional statements
and loops were terminated with CLOSE, for example:

    if foo() then baz() close;
    until foo() then baz() close;

Whilst CLOSE is still accepted by the compiler, it is better to use ENDIF,
ENDUNTIL etc., as more syntax checking is then possible.
