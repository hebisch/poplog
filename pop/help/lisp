HELP LISP                                     John Williams, August 1986

From Version 13, POPLOG will contain only one Lisp system, a complete
implementation of Common Lisp. For details, see HELP * CLISP.

An older "toy" system, known as LIB LISP, that implemented the subset of
MACLISP used by Winston in his textbook 'Artificial Intelligence', has
now been WITHDRAWN.

There is a third educational system, known as LIB * OLDLISP and
described in HELP * OLDLISP. This was produced for teaching purposes and
instead of compiling, it translates a simple dialect of Lisp to POP-11,
which can then be compiled, stored in a file, etc.
