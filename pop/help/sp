HELP SP                             Jonathan Laventhol, 16 September 1983.

The procedure "sp" is used for printing a given number of spaces on the
terminal.  So

    sp(number)

works just like

    repeat number times pr(space) endrepeat;

"space" is a constant containing a single space character.
