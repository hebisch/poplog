HELP SYSPR                                            Steven Hardy, March 1982

    syspr(<item>);

SYSPR is the default value of the user-assignable variable *PR. It takes a
single argument, which it prints (usually with *SYS_SYSPR). If <item> is a
data structure, then SYSPR does

    class_print(datakey(<item>))(<item>);

Users can therefore alter the printing of defined item classes by changing
the procedure CLASS_PRINT. For example:

    recordclass triple first second third;

    define pr_triple(item);
        pr('<triple: ');
        appdata(item,spr);
        pr('>');
    enddefine;

    pr_triple -> class_print(datakey(constriple(1,2,3)));
