HELP CHARERR

    charerr(<character>);

This procedure is used by the error-printing routine *SYSPRMISHAP to print
characters at the terminal. It is initialised via the value of SYS$ERROR on
startup of POP-11. The output device used is returned by *POPDEVERR. The
current column of output is held in the variable POP_CHARERR_COL.

The variable *CUCHARERR is to CHARERR as *CUCHAROUT is to *CHAROUT i.e.
SYSPRMISHAP actually uses whatever is the value of CUCHARERR, the default
value being CHARERR.
