HELP BY                                             A. Sloman, April 1985

This word is used in one form of the FOR statement, viz:

    for <variable> from <expression1> by <expression2> to <expression3> do
        <actions>
    endfor

This binds the variable to the result of evaluating the first expression and
then performs <actions>; the second expression is then added to the variable.
If it is less than or equal to the third expression the actions are performed
again. The addition, testing and execution of actions is repeated until the
variable exceeds the value of the third expression.

If expression2 is negative (before the loop is entered) then the termination
test uses "<" instead of ">".

In this form the 'by <expression2>' can be omitted; it will be assumed to be
'by 1'. The same applies to 'from <expression1>'.
