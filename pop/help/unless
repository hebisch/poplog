HELP UNLESS                                        Steven Hardy, January 1978

The conditional statement

    unless <condition> then <action> endunless

is equivalent to:

    if not(<condition>) then <action> endif

UNLESS statements may have an *ELSE branch (and also *ELSEIF and *ELSEUNLESS
branches).
