HELP LPR                                         John Williams, Apr 1989

    <ENTER> lpr [-<flags>] [<filenames>]
    <ENTER> lprmr [-<flags>]

<ENTER> LPR provides a Ved interface to the Unix lpr command, for
printing files.

If you are unfamiliar with lpr, you should read MAN * LPR.

<ENTER> LPR is exactly like the Unix lpr, except that if no <filenames>
are specified, the contents of the current Ved buffer are sent to the
printer. So, for example, to print this file on a printer called "tpb",
do:

    <ENTER> lpr -Ptpb <RETURN>

You can also print marked portions of files, using <ENTER> LPRMR. For
example, the command

    <ENTER> lprmr -Ptpb

will send the marked portion of the current file to the printer "tpb".
