HELP FOREVER                                        Steven Hardy, March 1982

This can be used in one form of a REPEAT statement, viz:

    repeat forever <actions> endrepeat;

The actions are repeated over and over again for ever. FOREVER is optional,
i.e.

    repeat <actions> endrepeat;

will also repeat for ever. FOREVER could be defined as:

    define macro forever;
      100000000000000000, "times"
    enddefine;
