HELP VEDFILLBLOCK                                      A.Sloman May 1987

Insert a rectangular block of characters into the VED buffer.

 vedfillblock(<int:L1>,<int:C1>,<int:L2>,<int:C2>,<character>)

Keywords: VED block insert buffer

L1,C2 represent a line and column in the VED buffer, as do L2,C2.
The two positions are taken as opposite corners of a rectangular block
of text to be filled with the character specified.

* VEDREFRESHBLOCK is used to refresh the screen.

Since the first four arguments are taken to be any two opposite corners
of the required block of text, the following combinations are all
equivalent:

    L1 C1 L2 C2;  L1 C2 L2 C1; L2 C2 L1 C1; L2 C1 L1 C2

This procedure is useful for packages that implement windows occupying
arbitrary rectangular portions of the screen, and for programs that
insert or delete blocks of text which are not made of complete lines.
