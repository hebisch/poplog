HELP SRCFILES                               Andrew Law, Aug. 1987

    This file explains where source files are stored and how to access
them. This file will only be useful to users at sites that own
source files - see your system manager.

    The source files contain the code for built in procedures. The
source files are located in:

    $usepop/pop/src
    $usepop/pop/lisp/src
    $usepop/pop/plog/src

The contents of these are described in DOC *SYSSPEC
