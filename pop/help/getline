    getline(<item>)

This procedure takes an item as argument. It first prints out the item, and
then uses *READLINE to read in a line of text. For

    2 -> n;
    getline([PLEASE TYPE ^N WORDS]) -> x;
    ** [PLEASE TYPE 2 WORDS]
    ? GO NORTH

    x =>
    ** [GO NORTH]

GETLINE can be defined as follows:

    define getline(item) -> result;
        item =>
        readline() -> result;
    enddefine;
