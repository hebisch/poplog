HELP RETURN                                        Steven Hardy, February 1978

RETURN is a syntax word. Its effect is to terminate execution of the current
procedure, as if it were equivalent to the (illegal) command:

    goto enddefine;

If you wish the procedure to leave some result on the stack before it stops,
you can specify the result in parentheses after RETURN, e.g.

    return(x,y);

If the procedure has any "output locals", then their values are put onto the
stack before the procedure finishes, even if the termination is achieved by
RETURN. (See HELP *DEFINE, *ASSIGN).
