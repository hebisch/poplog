HELP REQUESTLINE                                 A. Sloman April 1982

This is like READLINE except that it takes an argument which is to be used
as the prompt (a string - see HELP READLINE), in place of the '? ' used by
READLINE.  For example:

    requestline('please type your name:- ') -> name;
    please type your name:- joe bloggs
    name =>
    ** [joe bloggs]

See HELP *  READLINE, *LISTREAD, *GETLINE
