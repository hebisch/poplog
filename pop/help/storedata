                SAVING A DATABASE IN A DISC FILE
                ====== = ======== == = ==== ====

If you wish to save the current state of your database (see the DATABASE
demo) in a file, then you will find the procedure STOREDATA useful.

It takes the name of a disc file as argument. For example, if you wish to
store the current database in a file called 'mydata.p', type:

    storedata("mydata");

or, equivalently:

    storedata('mydata.p');

later, e.g. in another programming session, you can restore the
contents of the database by typing:

    load mydata.p;

This can be used for writing programs which learn by interacting with the
user.  What they learn in one session can be stored in a file and used in the
next session.

You can instead of the above, write

    file database in mydata.p;
