HELP SWL                                             Steven Hardy, July 1982

The VED command ENTER SWL (Swap Word Left) swaps the word 'under' the cursor
with the word to its left. The cursor is left over the word so repeated use
of SWL moves the same word. A newline is counted as a word so SWL moves a
word at the beginning of a line to the end of the previous line.

A 'word' is a sequence of characters not containing a space. If the cursor is
initially over a space, the word to the left of the cursor is swapped with
the word to its left.
