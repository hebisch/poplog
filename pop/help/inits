    inits(<integer>) -> <string>

Given an integer, this procedure produces a STRING of the given size. The
components of a string must be integers in the range 0 to 255. The initial
value of all components is 0.  When the system prints a string it prints the
characters corresponding to the integers in the string. Strings are typed in
by putting string quotes, ', around the characters to go into the string, for
example:

    'THIS IS A STRING'
