HELP LOAD                                           Steve Hardy, October 1981

    load <filename>;

This command tells the POP-11 system to read (or 'compile') a file from
long-term memory. The file must have been created earlier with VED.

Note that -load- is a syntax word, not a procedure, it reads the literal
text up to the end of line, a semi-colon, or the end of the current
input stream, whichever is found first, makes a string of all the
characters so found, and plants instructions in which that string is
given as argument to -compile-. It also plants a call to the
user-definable procedure -loadwarning-, which by default prints out a
message saying that the file is being loaded.
