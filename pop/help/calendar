HELP CALENDAR                                    JL Cunningham, 13 July 1983

LIB CALENDAR provides a VED command to create a calendar, suitable for
printing on a printer at least 120 columns wide. It should be easy to
modify it for other purposes. To use it (after loading it with LIB CALENDAR),
inside VED do

        ENTER CALENDAR

this produces a calendar for the current year. To produce a calendar for,
e.g. 1979, do

        ENTER CALENDAR 1979

After the calendar has been created, it may be inspected using VED, or
printed by

        ENTER PRINT

(see HELP * PRINTING).

LIB CALENDAR also defines a useful procedure for calculating which day of
the week a particular date occurred on - this takes a date and returns a
number from 1 to 7. E.g.

        : day_in_week(25,12,1983)=>
        ** 1

Christmas 1983 falls on a Sunday.

        : day_in_week(sysdaytime())=>
        ** 4

Today is Wednesday.
