HELP KSUSPEND                                         Steven Hardy, March 1982

This procedure, which takes an integer as argument, kills the current
process.  Thus, it behaves a little like EXITTO(RUNPROC). However EXITTO would
leave the stack unaltered.  KSUSPEND passes back exactly the given number of
items from the stack.
