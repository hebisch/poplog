HELP SYSCREATE                                   Steven Hardy, March 1982

    syscreate(<file>, <access mode>, <organization>) -> device or false;

This procedure creates a disc file and returns a device record for the
file. The <filename> should be a string. The permissible access modes are:

        0 - Read only
        1 - Write only
        2 - Read and Write

Permissible values for <organization> are

(a) FALSE: For disk files and pipes, this value will optimise the device
for single character input or output, otherwise there is no difference
between <false> and <true>. For terminals this gives normal interactive
line mode (i.e. only whole lines can be read).

(b) The word "line" (or "record"): For all kinds of device, this value
will mean that *SYSREAD will read from the device only up to the next
newline character.

(c) TRUE: implies that the file is block-oriented; the precise meaning of
this varies from device to device. For a terminal it means that all
characters will be treated as break characters and that no echoing will be
done. This is the organization used by VED. The device is initially set up
for 'rare' mode (i.e. cbreak, -echo, -nl, -tabs) and no prompt is output
for read operations.

Essentially then, use <false> for character stream I/O on text files,
"line" for line input on text files, and <true> for block I/O on disk
files or pipes and rare or raw mode on terminals.

If for any reason the file cannot be created, SYSCREATE returns FALSE.

For more information on Input/Output procedures see REF *SYSIO.
