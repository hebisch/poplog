-- Introduction -------------------------------------------------------

Popforum is a mailing list for  people who are interested in Poplog  and
other Pop languages. This  list is one of  the services provided by  the
Poplog and Pop Languages User Group. So  far the main uses of the  forum
have been:

    *   discussing the future directions of Poplog;
    *   announcements of enhancements, conferences, or ideas;
    *   requests for help on various topics.


-- Members List -------------------------------------------------------

A list of popforum members is maintained by the administrator. This list
is sent  to  new  members,  and is  occasionally  sent  to  all  members
popforum, so that people with like  interests can get in touch. You  can
mail to all members of the list by mailing to:

    popforum%hplb@uk.ac.uknet   (THIS NO LONGER WORKS)

All mail to popforum is archived, because there are occasionally debates
or questions that are relevant  later. You can request 'back-issues'  of
mail discussions - see below.


-- Joining Popforum --------------------------------------------------

If you want to join popforum, or to request back-issues, simply post to:

    popforum-admin%hplb@uk.ac.uknet (THIS NO LONGER WORKS)


-- Etiquette ----------------------------------------------------------

Since responsible people are reluctant to post trivial or dull questions
to everyone, some members (our Agony Aunts & Uncles) have volunteered to
field these kinds  of requests. These  people are listed  at the end  of
this file. To find out who is currently available to help post a request
to comp.lang.pop or the mailing list.

DO NOT POST IRRELEVANT ADVERTISEMENTS OR ANNOUNCEMENTS


-- Books and Resources List -------------------------------------------

The Poplog  and Pop  Languages User  Group maintains  a list  of  books,
papers, companies, and other resources  related to Poplog. Some of  this
information may be  available in  help files  on your  system (see  HELP
*RESOURCES for details), and also

    http://www.poplog.org


-- Services and Contacts ----------------------------------------------

(1) Popforum Administrator
        E-mail: pop-forum-request@cs.bham.ac.uk
            Please send  all  e-mail requests  to  this address.

        This covers such things as:
            *   subscribing,
            *   back-issues,
            *   members list,
            *   books and resources list.

(2) Popforum
        E-mail: pop-forum@cs.bham.ac.uk
            Send to this address to  have your message broadcast to  all
            subscribers.
            Please do not post irrelevant advertisements. People who
            abuse this email list will be reported to their service
            providers or local system managers, and may have their
            accounts terminated.



(3) Agony Uncles
        Suggestions and  advice  can  be  sought  from  pop-forum  which
        generally provides solutions quickly. However, you may feel that
        that you do not wish to publicise your problems, perhaps because
        they are too "trivial" or perhaps because they are sensitive. In
        this case, you  can write  to one or  more of  the agony  uncles
        below. They will  try to  answer your  questions personally.  If
        they do not  know an  answer, or your  problem is  intrinsically
        interesting, then they may  put the question  to the forum,  but
        without using your name. So you  should get an answer mailed  to
        you in person, or by reading the ensuing discussion. If you  are
        prepared to volunteer as an agony uncle, let me know.

        + When writing to one of the volunteers, please clearly indicate
        + that you are writing in that context. (Otherwise the volunteer
        + may think it is misdirected mail!)
