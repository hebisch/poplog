HELP END                                            Steven Hardy, January 1982

This word is equivalent to ENDDEFINE in procedure definitions. It is retained
for historical purposes (because some old library files use it to terminate
procedure definitions). See *CLOSE for an account of a similar anachronistic
word.

See HELP
    *DEFINE    - for form and content of procedure definitions
    *ENDDEFINE - use of the syntax word ENDDEFINE
