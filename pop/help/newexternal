HELP NEWEXTERNAL                                Ian Rogers, October 1991


See HELP * EXTERNAL for an overview of facilities for externally loading
procedures written in non-poplog languages. REF * EXTERNAL gives
additional technical information.

LIB * EXTERNAL provides a convenient interface to the Pop-11 external
load mechanism, using LIB * C_DEC for C and LIB * FORTRAN_DEC for
Fortran.

These facilities were extended by LIB * NEWC_DEC for C. For the sake of
upward compatibility with existing programs the old version has been
left. Users are recommended to use the new, more convenient mechanisms,
explained in HELP * NEWC_DEC, by invoking LIB * NEWEXTERNAL instead of
LIB * EXTERNAL

See HELP * NEWC_DEC for details of the new facilities for declaring C
datatypes, structures and functions.
