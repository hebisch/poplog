HELP TRANSFER                               Steven Hardy, December 1981

This help file describes how to move chunks of one disc file into others.
Much of this is superceded by ENTER-TI, ENTER-TO, ENTER-MI, ENTER-MO.
See HELP * INOROUT

This is accomplished using the commands ENTER-WR and ENTER-R, or by using
ENTER-COPY and ENTER-YANK

-- USING COPY AND YANK ---------------------------------------------------

Suppose you want to copy a portion of FILE1 into FILE2. First get the former
into the editor:
    ENTER VED FILE1

Then, using the mark range buttons, mark the portion of the file you wish to
copy. Then tell VED to copy it into a special temporary store, thus:
    ENTER VED COPY

Then get the other file into VED:
    ENTER VED FILE2

Then put the cursor where you want the text inserted and give the command
    ENTER VED YANK

If you wish the text to be deleted from the first file, then instead of
ENTER VED COPY, above, you could use
    ENTER VED D
That will delete the marked range, but keep a copy of it in the special
temporary store.

-- USING WR and R --------------------------------------------------------
This method uses an ordinary disk file as the intermediate store. It is
useful if you want to have a separate file of the chunk of text copied.

The ENTER-WR command is used to create a copy of a portion of one file into
a new file. Suppose the file from which we wish to copy a portion is called
OLD (or OLD.P). First get the file OLD displayed (using 'ENTER ved old' or
': ved old;'). Select the portion that you wish to copy out and mark it
using the MARK-FIRST and MARK-LAST keys (these are F7 and F8 on the
VISUAL200). A solid white line should appear to the left of the selected
text. Now give the command 'ENTER wr temp' (WR for Write Range) to write the
marked lines to the temporary, intermediate file called, in this case, TEMP.

Once this has been done, you will have a new file called TEMP containing
the selected lines. You can verify this by giving the command 'ENTER ved temp'.

Now switch to the file into which you wish to transfer the contents of the
file TEMP. Suppose this file is called NEW (or NEW.P). Give an 'ENTER ved
new' command and select the point at which you want the text from TEMP to
be inserted (say the end of the file NEW). Position the cursor immediately
above the chosen point and then give an 'ENTER r temp' command (R for Read) to
read in the TEMP file at that point.
