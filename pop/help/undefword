HELP UNDEFWORD                                  Revised by Fran Evelyn, July 85

    undefword(<object>) -> <word>

An object of type UNDEF is assigned to a variable when it is first declared.
Given an object of type UNDEF, UNDEFWORD returns the word for which the
UNDEF record was created, that is, the original word to which the object was
assigned, e.g.

    vars y;               ;;; First declaration of X

    y =>
    ** <undef y>

    undefword(y) =>
    ** y
