HELP SORT                                       Steven Hardy, December 1977

This procedure takes a list as argument and returns as result a sorted copy,
for example:

    sort([12 43 14 -9]) =>
    ** [-9 12 14 43]
    sort([cat apple goat banana]) =>
    ** [apple banana cat goat]

If the list contains numbers only, then the operation < (less than) is used
to decide where to put things in the sorted list. If it contains words or
strings, then the procedure ALPHABEFORE is used. If the list contains both
words and numbers an error will result.

SORT is defined in terms of the more general procedure *SYSSORT.

See HELP * ALPHABEFORE, *SYSSORT.

For sorting lines in VED, see HELP * MARK /SMR.
