At present the editor VED does not provide a general UNDO facility.
However, it is possible to undo certain deletions as follows.
Each of these commands may be used several times in succession to
insert multiple copies of the previously deleted text.

On some terminals some of these operations are mapped onto function
keys. Users may map them onto key sequences using VEDSETKEY
(See HELP * VEDSETKEY)

-- <ENTER> y -----------------------------------------------------
or <ENTER> yank
   <ENTER> y <line number>

This can be used after delete marked range (ENTER D). The command
ENTER Y will read back into the current edit buffer the lines last
deleted by ENTER D. Y can be given an optional line number after
which the lines are to be inserted, e.g.

    <ENTER> y 0

to insert at the beginning of the file. The variable VEDDUMP holds a
list of the lines last deleted. They can be inserted several times using
YANK, in several different files.

-- <ENTER> yankl     (yank line) ------------------------------------

This command can be used to re-insert the line last deleted using
the DELETE LINE key, or the procedure VEDLINEDELETE.  The line last
deleted is held in the variable VVEDLINEDUMP.  The YANKL command can
be used to re-insert it as many times as required.  The line is
inserted after the cursor line. If the line deleted is empty, the
previously stored value is not overwritten.

-- <ENTER> yankw     (yank word) ------------------------------------

This command can be used to re-insert the last piece of text deleted
by one of the following keys which delete a portion of a line (the
corresponding procedure is indicated in parentheses:

    DELETE LINE TO LEFT OF CURSOR           (VEDCLEARHEAD())
    DELETE LINE TO RIGHT OF CURSOR          (VEDCLEARTAIL())
    DELETE WORD TO LEFT OF CURSOR           (VEDWORDLEFTDELETE())
    DELETE WORD TO RIGHT OF CURSOR          (VEDWORDRIGHTDELETE())

The last portion of text so deleted is held in the variable
VVEDWORDDUMP, and may be re-inserted as often as required using
YANKW.

-- <ENTER> splice -------------------------------------------------

This re-inserts the last portion of text removed by means of the
<ENTER> cut command or commands defined in terms of it, e.g.
<ENTER> ds, <ENTER> dsb. The deleted text is held in the variable
VVEDCUT_DUMP.
