HELP TRUE                                           Steven Hardy, October 1977

This variable has as its value the object TRUE (of dataword BOOLEAN) (although
since anything not FALSE is treated as TRUE by IF and other conditional
statements, there is no real need for the object TRUE). TRUE is returned when
appropriate by procedures with boolean results.
