HELP VEDYANKBLOCK                                     A.Sloman May 1987


vedyankblock(<vector of strings>)

"Yank" a vector of strings into the VED buffer as a block starting at
the current cursor location.

Keywords: VED yank block vector strings insert

This is used for packages that copy or move rectangular blocks of
text in a VED buffer.

Starting at the current cursor location, vedyankblock inserts one
string per line, each string starting at the same column as the original
cursor location.

If VEDSTATIC is true then the new strings will over-write the existing
text. Otherwise the previous text will be shifted to the right.

VEDREFRESHBLOCK is used to refresh the visible part of the buffer
affected, since on some terminals the refreshing done by vedinsertstring
is too slow.

VEDYANKBLOCK is used to define a number of the procedures mentioned
in HELP * VEDBLOCKS

WARNING:
    As explained in HELP * VEDCUTBLOCK, unexpected consequences may
    follow if some of the strings include tabs. In particular, the
    inserted text may not have exactly the same format as the original
    from which it was obtained. In that case further editing may be
    needed after insertion.
