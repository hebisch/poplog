HELP SECTION_CANCEL                                     A. Sloman April 1983

    section_cancel(<section_name>, zap_pdprops)

This can be used to unlink a section from the section tree, to save space.
To get access to a section record, use *CURRENT_SECTION inside a section.

The first argument is the name of the section to be cancelled. The second
argument is a boolean value; if TRUE, the value FALSE is assigned to the
*PDPROPS of all procedures local to the cancelled section, saving space. This
argument is optional and defaults to FALSE if omitted.

For an example of the use of SECTION_CANCEL see SHOWLIB ARRAYSCAN.

For full details of sections in POP-11 see REF *SECTIONS.
