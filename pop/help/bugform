BUG REPORTS

Since Poplog  is no  longer sold  as a  commercial product  there is  no
longer an "official" form for  reporting bugs or for making  enhancement
requests.

However, it is possible to ask the user community for help by  posting a
request to the comp.lang.pop news group.

There may be  additional mechanisms for  finding help available  through
the Poplog WEB site:

    http://www.poplog.org


If you do  wish to post  a request for  help, you can  make the task  of
helpers as easy as  possible by using  the rest of  this help file  as a
framework for your request.

Please  edit  the  file  as  appropriate,  then  post  it  WITHOUT  this
explanatory header.

Customers who  have  a maintenance  contract  with  ISL or  one  of  its
distributors are entitled to support -- in the form of bug-fixes,  work-
arounds, etc. -- for any problems  they are having. Please contact  your
supplier for details.

Note: If  you have  recently acquired  a new  version of  the  operating
system, and the bug  manifests itself ONLY on  the new version, then  it
MAY be the case that some of the libraries have changed and your problem
will go  away  if  you  re-link  Poplog,  as  described  in  HELP NEWPOP.

You can expect more helpful replies from other users if you follow these
guidelines:

1. In the case of bugs, please keep original code/saved images, etc.,
   manifesting the bug available in case required for testing.

2. Please always mention which make and model of computer you are using,
   which operating system and version it is running and the version of
   Poplog you are using.

3. Please give a precise description, including sufficient code to
   reproduce undesired behaviour.

4. Include a record of interaction if possible.

5. Please do not use vague statements such as:
    "There's something wrong with procedure FOO"
    "If I do X the results are bizarre"
    "I can't get X to work"
    "X doesn't seem able to handle big lists"
    "X doesn't work inside the editor..."

6. If the problem is a discrepancy between documentation and observed
   behaviour please specify which documentation file or manual.
