--- TEMPORARY DOCUMENTATION ON TELEVIDEO VERSION OF VED --------------

There are two library files for Televideo terminals (unsupported).
LIB * TVI is for model TVI 920C, emulating a VT52 VDU.

LIB * TVI925 is for the TVI 925 VDU. For details on the latter do

    SHOWLIB * TVI925

To load it do

    lib tvi925;

The rest of this file is concerned with LIB TVI.

To use the TVI 920C version of VED it is necessary to do

    lib tvi;

before you run VED. This takes a few seconds, but you can, instead,
create a saved image to avoid frequent re-compilation.

Use down arrow key to read on.

LIB TVI caused real problems because the terminals don't correspond to
the manual.  I assume this is because of VT52 emulation.

Note: If you use the full power of the Televideo terminal, which
includes the ability to insert and delete lines (used for scrolling this
window) you will find a terrible screen flicker. It seems to have an
inherent design fault. You can overcome this by the following:

    true -> vednolineinsert;

(which can go into your vedinit.p file if you use the Televideo often).
The result will be re-writing of the whole window every time you need to
scroll it up or down.

-- KEYS ON THE TELEVIDEO -----------------------------------------------

The following assumes twelve function keys, F1 to F12, which transmit

    ESC ? CHAR.

Then there are 4 more keys marked

    Char Insert, Char delete, Line insert, Line Delete.

Above the keypad are three more keys, one simulating GOLD (ESC P) and
the other two duplicating Char Insert, and Line Delete. !!!

The four Arrow function keys work as on the Visual 200, and are left for
large moves up, down, left, right, as with the Visual 200 version.

The general plan is as follows

    Keys F1 to F11 work exactly as on V200.
    F12  = VEDEXCHANGEPOSITION (ESC P on V200)
    So:

    F1  = Delete line to left of cursor
    F2  = Delete whole of cursor line
    F3  = delete line to right of cursor
    F4  = Delete word to left of cursor
    F5  = Delete word to right of cursor
    F6  = Move in or out of static mode
    F7  = Mark as beginning of range
    F8  = Mark as end of range
    F9  = Move marked range to after cursor line
    F10 = Push current position onto VEDPOSITIONSTACK
    F11 = POP top of VEDPOSITIONSTACK - i.e. go back to that position
    F12 = Exchange current position with top of position stack.

    CHAR INSERT key  = insert line above
    CHAR DELETE key  = delete char under cursor  (like CTRL-P)
    LINE INSERT key  = insert line below
    LINE DELETE key  = line delete (as does F2)

    The key with blue dot, above keypad 7 does screen refresh
    The next two keys duplicate the CHAR INSERT and LINE DELETE KEYS.

Holding the FUNCT button down changes all keys so that they transmit
CTRL-A, then the normal character (controlled by shift) then CR

This means that CTRL-A can no longer be used for VEDSCREENLEFT However,
VEDREADFUNCTIONKEY has been defined so that three CTRL-A's in succession
will do screen left!

The FUNC key has been used to modify the keypad, so that the numbers 1
to 9 with FUNC key depressed work exactly as on V200. I.e. the move
cursor in 8 directions.

For bigger jumps do ESC then key. E.g. ESC 9 does VEDCHARUPLOTS, and ESC
3 does VEDCHARDOWNRIGHTLOTS.

The Comma and Dot, with FUNC do word left or word right.

Instead of ENTER it is necessary to press FUNC and RETURN,
    or FUNC and ENTER
    (The rather silly ENTER key on the Televideo just duplicates RETURN!)

    FUNC a  = go to top of file
    FUNC z  = go to end of file
    FUNC g  = REDO last command.
    FUNC -  = REDO last command. (I.e. use key next to ENTER key)
    FUNC 0  = put cursor back on command line without removing previous
                command

To extend the range of function facilities, copy [pop.lbi.ved]tvi.p, and
edit VEDREADFUNCTIONKEY to suit yourself.  The system version may be
extended if there are good suggestions.
