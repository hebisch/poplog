HELP MOVE_SUBVECTOR                        A. Sloman July 1982

    move_subvector(n1, vector1, n2, vector2, num)

This copies the contents of num fields, starting at location n1 in
vector1, to fields in vector2, starting in location n2, where vector1
and vector2 are any vector-class structures.

vector2 may be the same as vector1, for re-locating the contents of one
vector.

Note: vector locations start counting from 1 in POP11.
