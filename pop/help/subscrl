HELP SUBSCRL                                         Steven Hardy, October 1977

    subscrl(integer, list) -> item;
    item -> subscrl(integer, list);

This procedure is used to access lists. If the value of the variable L is a
list then:

    l(4) =>

is equivalent to

    subscrl(4, l) =>

For example:

    [a b c d] -> l;
    l(4) =>
    ** d
