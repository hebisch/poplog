HELP IT                                          John Williams, Jan 1991

The global variable IT is used by various *DATABASE procedures to store
the last item they have operated on.

In the case of *ADD and *ALLADD, IT is set to the last item added to
the database.

*REMOVE, *ALLREMOVE and *FLUSH ensure that IT is set to the last item
removed from the database.

*LOOKUP, *PRESENT and *ISIN save the item they retrieved from the
database in IT.

IT is also set by *FOREACH, each time round the loop, to the current
matching database item.

See also HELP * DATABASE and HELP * THEM.
