HELP DISCAPPEND                                   Mark Rubinstein, April 1985

    discappend(<filename>) -> <character_consumer>;

DISCAPPEND is for opening files for updating.  Its use is analogous to *DISCOUT
- it takes a file specification (but not a device record) and produces a
character consumer.  The only difference is that if the file already exists
(and is readable) then it first consumes all the characters already in the
file, so any more characters consumed will be appended to the end of the file.
