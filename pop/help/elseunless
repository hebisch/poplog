HELP ELSEUNLESS                                    Steven Hardy Mar 1982

This introduces a second condition in an -if- or -unless- statement. The
statement

    elseunless <CONDITION> then

is completely equivalent to:

    elseif not(<CONDITION>) then


For example:

    if <CONDITION1> then <ACTION1>
    elseunless <CONDITION2> then <ACTION2>
    else <ACTION3>
    endif

When the POP-11 system executes this -if- statement it first tests
<CONDITION1>. Unless it evaluates to -false- <ACTION1> is performed. If
<CONDITION1> is -false-, then <CONDITION2> is tested; if this is -false-
then <ACTION2> is performed, otherwise <ACTION3> is performed.
