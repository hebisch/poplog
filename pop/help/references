References are one element data-structures used by some system and
library procedures, and occasionally useful for passing variable
information around between user procedures. They are created by means of
the procedure CONSREF and their contents are accessed or updated
by the procedure CONT.

See REF DATA and REF KEYS for an overview of POP data types.
