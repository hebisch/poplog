-- General Introduction -----------------------------------------------

The file DOC * SYSSPEC gives an overview of the Poplog Directory
structure.

The Pop11 library of demonstrations and utilities is found in the
sub-directories
    $usepop/pop/lib/*

Prolog specific libraries are found in
    $usepop/pop/plog/lib

$usepop/pop/lib is composed on the following subdirectories

auto            demo            lib             sun
data            flavours        psv             turtle
database        include         ved

See below for a description of their contents.

HELP *LIBRARIES
    For introduction to libraries and library facilities
REF *LIBRARY

    Program library search lists
HELP *PROLOGLIBLIST
    Library directories used by Prolog
DOC *SYSSPEC /Program libraries
    A general overview of the structure of the Poplog system


-- Autoloadable Libraries ---------------------------------------------

    $usepop/pop/lib/auto:

These are 'autoloaded' (see HELP *AUTOLOAD). Other autoloadable
directories may be added to *POPAUTOLIST. The default value of
*POPAUTOLIST is easily altered in /pop/pop/init.p which is compiled
whenever POP11 starts up (see HELP *INITIAL).

Files in $usepop/pop/lib/lib are only loaded if this is explicitly
requested by the LIB command, or the USES command. (See LIB.P and
USES.P). The directories accessed by LIB and USES are those listed in
POPUSESLIST which may also be set up in /pop/pop/init.p


-- Data Libraries -----------------------------------------------------

    $usepop/pop/lib/data:

This contains data used by some of the other library packages.


-- Database Libraries -------------------------------------------------

    $usepop/pop/lib/database:

This contains autoloadable libraries used by the database facility
see HELP *DATABASE


-- Demo Libraries -----------------------------------------------------

    $usepop/pop/lib/demo:

This contains demonstration programs

    $usepop/pop/lib/lib/blocks:
aread.me        blocks.p        driver.p        fits.p          utils.p

This contains demonstration programs for a robot which understands
English and manipulates blocks in a simulated world.


-- Flavours Libraries --------------------------------------------------

    $usepop/pop/lib/flavours:

This contains libraries used by the flavours object oriented programming
language.

See HELP *FLAVOURS
REF *FLAVOURS


-- Include Libraries --------------------------------------------------

    $usepop/pop/lib/include:

Header files e.g., used for systems significant constants


-- PSV Libraries ------------------------------------------------------

    $usepop/pop/lib/psv:

Some saved images (including the prolog and lisp images)


-- Sun Libraries ------------------------------------------------------

    $usepop/pop/lib/sun:

Library files needed used for sun workstations. See HELP *VEDSUN


-- Libraries Concerned With The X Interface ---------------------------

See HELP * X

SHOWLIB * POPXLIB


-- Turtle Libraries ---------------------------------------------------

    $usepop/pop/lib/turtle:

Library files used by the turtle facility, e.g.,

HELP *TURTLE, TEACH *TURTLE
    Introduction to the Pop11 turtle
HELP *TURTLE, TEACH *TURTLE
    Introduction to the Pop11 turtle

-- VED Libraries ------------------------------------------------------

    $usepop/pop/lib/ved:

Many extensions to the editor commands are to be found in
    $usepop/pop/lib/ved

See for example VED_DM.P. If a VED ENTER command is given which is not
recognised, then 'VED_' is attached to the command, and a search is made
for an autoloadable file which will define an appropriate procedure.
E.g.

        <ENTER> dm

will cause the file $usepop/pop/lib/ved/ved_dm.p to be compiled, and the
procedure defined therein to be obeyed.

See HELP *VED


-- Prototype libraries ------------------------------------------------

and comment. To make any experimental libraries supplied here
accessible, do:
