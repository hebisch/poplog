HELP RUNPROC                                          Steven Hardy, March 1982

    runproc(integer, process);

This procedure, which takes an integer and a process as argument, runs the
given process. The given number of items are transferred from the callers
stack to that of the process.

If RUNPROC is called recursively (that is, by a process itself started by
RUNPROC) then the current process is not 'swapped out' as would be the case
with RESUME.

See HELP * PROCESS, *RESUME
