HELP QUITLOOP                                   Steven Hardy, February 1982

This is used to jump out of a loop, for example:

    define search(item, list);
        until list == [] do
        ..........
        if hd(list) + item then quitloop endif;
        ..........
        enduntil;
        ..........
    enddefine;

QUITLOOP is equivalent to '*GOTO just after the next ENDUNTIL (or ENDWHILE or
similar closing bracket)'. QUITLOOP can optionally be followed by an integer N
in parentheses in which case it jumps out of the Nth enclosing loop, for
example:

    quitloop(2);

N.B. QUITLOOP is not a procedure and cannot be called by a procedure inside
the loop: it must be used inside the loop body itself.
