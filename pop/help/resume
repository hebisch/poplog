HELP RESUME                                        Steven Hardy, March 1982

    resume(integer, process);

This procedure, which takes an integer and a process record as argument,
suspends the current process and then activates the given one. The given
number of items are transferred to the stack of the new process from the
stack of the current one.

Thus, the new process runs within the same call of RUNPROC as does the
current one. If the new process calls SUSPEND then control will return from
the original call of RUNPROC.
