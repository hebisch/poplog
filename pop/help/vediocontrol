HELP VEDIOCONTROL                  updated Mark Rubinstein  October 1985

    lib vediocontrol

This command alters POPDEVRAW so that terminal interactions using
rawcharin and rawcharout will switch the terminal into a mode in which
various control characters are read in raw. I.e. they do not have their
normal effects.

For details do SHOWLIB * VEDIOCONTROL.

See also REF * SYSIO /SYS_IO_CONTROL .

On unix machines only the command

    <ENTER> stop

invokes the procedure ved_stop which suspends the current process and
takes you back to the CSHELL (or Shell).
