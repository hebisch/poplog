Default key bindings in VED prior to Poplog 14.5.

These key bindings have been superseded as the default in Poplog 14.5 by
a new set of bindings described in HELP * VEDKEYS. Anyone who wants to
restore these bindings as the default can do so by including at the
start of their "vedinit.p" file the two lines:

    vedoldkeys -> veddefaultkeys;
    veddefaultkeys();

WARNING: some of the bindings described below are over-ridden by
function key assignments in particular terminal customising libraries,
e.g. LIB * VEDVT220KEYS (as described in HELP * VEDVT220KEYS)

-- Introduction -------------------------------------------------------

This file describes the set of key bindings which made up the default
keymap for VED prior to Poplog 14.5. This has since been superseded by a
new set described in HELP * VEDKEYS, so the key bindings described here
are now referred to as the ``old'' bindings, and are associated with the
procedure VEDOLDKEYS. You can at any time restore VED's keymap to
exactly the state described here simply by calling the procedure:

    vedoldkeys();

NB: this will erase any custom bindings you may have installed.

These old bindings are not all terribly consistent, being derived from
the original version of VED which used character sequences generated by
the function keys on a Visual 200 VDU. Newcomers to VED are advised to
stick with the new defaults described in HELP * VEDKEYS, although
confirmed EMACS users might like to use the alternative described in
HELP * VEDEMACS.

Most VED terminal libraries define their own key bindings to make use of
any function keys they might provide. These bindings will typically be
extra to those described here, but some libraries do redefine some of
the default key bindings to suit the layout of function keys. If in
doubt, check the help file for the terminal library you are using.

You can always prevent terminal libraries from defining extra key
bindings by assigning FALSE to the variable VEDFUNCTIONKEYS. A list of
help files describing different terminal configurations can be found in
HELP * VED/Terminal, with more detail in REF * VEDTERMINALS.


-- Checking current key bindings --------------------------------------

To find out what any particular key sequence is bound to, try:

    <ENTER> hk

This will ask you to press the key or key sequence. If there is a
corresponding procedure its name will be printed on the command line. If
nothing is printed then you have started the beginning of a key sequence
which is not complete. You can try completing the sequence in various
ways.

    <ENTER> hkey

is similar, but more verbose.

To define your own key bindings use the syntax VEDSET or the procedure
VEDSETKEY - see HELP *VEDSET, *VEDSETKEY. For lists of additional
relevant help files see HELP * VED


-- Changes for Poplog Version 14 --------------------------------------

Some new mappings from key sequences to VED functions have been provided
for the sake of users who have to use terminals without a good
collection of function keys, and without a convertible keypad. All such
mappings are marked "++" below.

In addition this file has been reorganised. The facilities are first
presented grouped according to function, and secondly according to
the key sequences that produce them.


-- Notation -----------------------------------------------------------

In the descriptions of key bindings which follow, the notation:

    ^X

(pronounced "control X") stands for the single character generated by
pressing the <CTRL> key and the X key simultaneously. Control characters
are traditionally written as upper case, but either case will do.

The notation:

    ESC x

(pronounced "escape X") is a two character sequence, generated by
pressing first the <ESC> key and then the unshifted X key. The case of
"x" is significant here. Not all keyboards have an <ESC> key clearly
marked. If you can't find one, it can be simulated by typing ^[. (Note
to EMACS users: VED will not accept META-X in place of ESC X.)

Longer sequences are built up in the obvious way, so that

    ESC ^X

is generated by pressing first <ESC> and then ^X.

The keys TAB, LF and RETURN are the tab, line-feed and carriage-return
keys. They are normally marked as such on the keyboard, but just in
case, the correspondences are:

    TAB     ^I
    LF      ^J
    RETURN  ^M

Some recently introduced keyboards no longer have the LF key,
unfortunately. The DEL or "delete" key may be marked in various ways,
but has no obvious alternative.

VED procedure names and variable names are written here in upper case to
make them stand out, but they are in fact lower case.

WARNING: distinguish upper and lower case. E.g. the following two are
different:
    ESC a
    ESC A

The second one requires the use of the SHIFT key. (Sometimes marked with
an upward pointing arrow).


-- Special Characters -------------------------------------------------

The characters

    ^O ^Q ^S ^X ^Y

are often interpreted specially by the operating system or by the
terminal and so are not usually used by VED.

The character ^C is used to interrupt VED and abort the current command.
On some systems a different character may be used as the interrupt
character. On VMS ^Y is the "abort" or "quit" character. Some, but not
all, Unix users also set it up as the "quit" character.


-- Key Bindings by Function -------------------------------------------


-- + Moving the Cursor ------------------------------------------------

       Key  Function                                    VED Procedure
       ---  --------                                    -------------

     ESC O   Move to middle column of screen,           SCREENMIDDLE
             (on current line). On VT100 initiates
                special sequences

        ^B  Move left one word                          WORDLEFT
        ^F  Move right one word                         WORD RIGHT

   ESC TAB  Move to next tab stop                       TABRIGHT


To go to a particular line number, do

    <ENTER> line-number

e.g,

    <ENTER> 123

to go to line 123. See also the section on 'Searching' below.


-- + Inserting --------------------------------------------------------

       Key  Function                                    VED Procedure
       ---  --------                                    -------------

     ESC )  Open new line above current                 LINEABOVE
     ESC *  Open new line below current                 LINEBELOW

All printing characters are inserted immediately at the current cursor
position. Characters after the cursor are normally shifted right to make
room, but setting VEDSTATIC causes existing characters to be overwritten
instead (see the section 'Switching Modes' below).

Tab and carriage return characters are interpreted as follows:

       TAB  Inserts a single tab character at the current cursor
            position, or if VEDNOTABS is TRUE, sufficient spaces to pad
            to the next tab stop. See HELP * VEDNOTABS.

    RETURN  In normal mode, this breaks the current line at the cursor
            position. In immediate mode (see HELP * IM), the line is
            sent to the compiler. On the status line (command line) it
            causes the current command to be obeyed.


-- + Deleting ---------------------------------------------------------

       Key  Function                                    VED Procedure
       ---  --------                                    -------------

        ^P  Delete character under cursor               DOTDELETE
       DEL  Delete character to left of cursor          CHARDELETE

        ^W  Delete word to left of cursor               WORDLEFTDELETE
        ^U  Delete line to left of cursor               CLEARHEAD

        ^R  Delete word to right of cursor              WORDRIGHTDELETE
        ^E  Delete line to right of cursor              CLEARTAIL
        ^]  Delete current line                         LINEDELETE

     ESC |  Delete marked range                         ENTER d  ++

     ESC ,  Delete region between stacked positions     ENTER cut ++
            (See HELP * VED_CUT,* VED_SPLICE)(The cut
            region can be re-inserted using "ESC ." (splice)

Note: additional delete facilities are described in the section on
the "kill" table, below.


-- + Re-inserting deleted text ----------------------------------------

The letter "y" for "yank" refers to retrieval of previously deleted
text.

       Key  Function                                    VED Procedure
       ---  --------                                    -------------
     ESC 9
     ESC y  Re-insert marked range last deleted         ENTER y     ++

     ESC 8  Yank whole line last deleted                ENTER yankl ++

    ESC ^U
    ESC ^W
     ESC 7  Yank word or part line last deleted.        ENTER yankw ++


     ESC .  Re-insert text last removed by ved_cut      ENTER splice ++
             (See "ESC ," above HELP * VED_CUT,* VED_SPLICE)

The last marked range deleted can be retrieved with ENTER y. The last
non-empty line deleted can be recovered with ENTER yankl. The last word
or part line deleted can be recovered with ENTER yankw. The last text
deleted with ENTER cut, can be recovered with ENTER splice. In all cases
the text is re-inserted at a location determined by where the cursor is.
"y" inserts after the current line. "yankl" inserts before the current
line so that it can undo vedlinedelete. "yankw" and "splice" insert at
the current cursor location, after which re-formatting may be necessary.

There is no ring or stack of delete buffers: only the last thing deleted
can be recovered. See HELP * YANK for full details.

Note that on many terminals, for any keystroke sequence leading to a
deletion of more than one character, prefixing the same key sequence
with ESC will undo the deletion.


-- + Searching --------------------------------------------------------

       Key  Function                                    VED Procedure
       ---  --------                                    -------------

     ESC /  Repeat last search forwards                 ENTER re_search
     ESC \  Repeat last search backwards           ENTER re_back_search

To search forwards for a given string, do

    <ENTER> /<string>
    <ENTER> "<string>

To search backwards for a given string, do

    <ENTER> \<string>
    <ENTER> `<string>

In both cases the second method finds only non-embedded strings.

See HELP * VEDSEARCH for a summary of additional search and replace
commands.

     ESC 3  Complete file name to left of cursor        FILECOMPLETE ++
            (See HELP * VEDFILECOMPLETE)


-- + The Command Line -------------------------------------------------

Not all terminals have a key marked "ENTER" that can be made to transmit
a special code to tell VED to move to the status line. So some
alternatives are provided.                                              ++

get the corresponding help, teach or ref file.
Try (for example) HELP * HELP.


-- Key Bindings by Key ------------------------------------------------

-- + Control Keys -----------------------------------------------------

If you use a terminal other than a VISUAL 200 some of the sequences may
have been re-assigned. For users who do not have a terminal with
'alternate keypad' mode, LIB KEYPAD may be useful. SHOWLIB KEYPAD
provides information.

Some of the VED functions can be achieved by control characters, i.e.
hold down the CTRL button and press a key. (CTRL-A is represented below
as ^A). Note that some of these functions may be over-ridden by
conversion to particular terminals. LIB VEDEMACS changes most of them.

       Key  Function                                    VED Procedure
       ---  --------                                    -------------

          (See HELP LMR)
      ^E  Delete to end of line                       CLEARTAIL

          Move cursor left one character
      ^I  TAB, like TAB key. Insert suitable number   (insert TAB)
          of spaces, or tabs, depending whether
          VEDNOTABS is true or false. See HELP * VEDNOTABS

      ^J  (LF key) Move to beginning of next line     NEXTLINE
       (Position of cursor is controlled by VEDLEFTMARGIN.)
      ^K  Move to top of screen                       SCREENUP
      ^L  Move to bottom of screen                    SCREENDOWN
      ^M  Same as RETURN. Insert new line             VEDDOCR
          (In "immediate mode" sends current line to the compiler)
      ^N  Change case of character under cursor       CHANGECASE
      ^O  Often trapped by operating system - can't be used.
      ^P  Delete character at cursor Position         DOTDELETE
      ^Q  Often trapped by operating system - can't be used.
      ^R  Delete WORD to RIGHT of cursor              WORDRIGHTDELETE

      ^X  On VMS turns this into ^U, otherwise undefined
      ^Y  Interrupt and abort POP11 on VMS.
          You can lose your work! (On Unix,if set as QUIT character
          this aborts Poplog if typed twice within a second. Otherwise it
          calls SETPOP).

      ^Z  Move to right of current line               TEXTRIGHT
          (NOT available to Unix users who use ^Z as
           the suspend character)
      ^]  Delete current line                         LINEDELETE
      ^_  (CTRL and underscore) REDO last command     REDOCOMMAND
            (doesn't work on all terminals.)
      ^^  (CTRL and "^" button). Not used
      ^\  (CTRL and "\"). Not used
          (Sometimes set to "suspend process" on Unix.)
      ^@  Null character. Ignored by VED because some
          terminals send spurious nulls.


       DEL  Delete character to left of cursor          CHARDELETE


-- + Escape Keys ------------------------------------------------------

Several commands may be given by typing the <ESC> key followed by
another key. These look arbitrary. The sequences are in fact mostly
those produced by VT52 or Visual 200 function keys, for which VED was
originally used. But you can also type them directly yourself. Note that
the upper case letters, e.g. <ESC> H need the SHIFT key to be pressed.

Unless you are using a Visual 200 VDU it is very likely that the effect
of some of these sequences will have been redefined to suit the codes
generated by certain function keys. For instance, some of the sequences
marked 'unused' may be used by your keyboard if it is not a VISUAL 200.
LIB VEDEMACS redefines most of them.

You can always check with the ENTER hk command, as described above.

-- Longer Sequences ---------------------------------------------------

On the VISUAL 200 VED puts the keypad into a special mode in which some
of the keys translate a three character sequence starting with <ESC> ?

See HELP * VEDKEY5 for information about a convenient alteration of the
keypad on the Visual 200.

On the VT100 the three character sequences start with <ESC> O.


-- The "kill" table ---------------------------------------------------

Sequences starting ESC ^K are used to kill (delete) or retrieve text.
