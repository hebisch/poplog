HELP POPDEVIN                                   Revised by Fran Evelyn, July 85

    popdevin -> device

POPDEVIN is an active variable which holds the device for the standard input
channel (read from by *CHARIN). Assigning to it,

    <device> -> popdevin

enables a new device to be assigned to the standard channel, and can be used
along with the updating POPDEVIN and POPDEVERR to redirect standard I/O after
SYSFORKing a child process, and before SYSEXECUTEing a new image.
