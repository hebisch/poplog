HELP WORDQUOTE                                  Revised by Fran Evelyn, July 85

The non-alphanumeric symbol " begins and ends a quoted word, i.e. one which is
not to be interpreted as a variable name. For example

    "word" -> x;

assigns the word WORD to be the value of the variable x, leading to results
such as the following:

    x =>
    ** word

    "word" =>
    ** word
