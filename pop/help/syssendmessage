TEACH * FLAVOURS.

    syssendmessage(<message>, <instance>);
    <value> -> syssendmessage(<message>, <instance>);

Sends the message MESSAGE (which should be a word) to the instance
INSTANCE.  Any arguments required for the processing of the message should
be on the *STACK.  The updater is used for sending an update message.  The
steps taken in the processing of a message is described below.  The class
apply of an instance is -syssendmessage- so the above are equivalent to

        <instance>(<message>);

    and

        <value> -> <instance>(<message>);
