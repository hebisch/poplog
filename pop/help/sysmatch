HELP SYSMATCH                            updated Mark Rubinstein  October 1985

    sysmatch(pattern, structure);

SYSMATCH takes two arguments - a pattern and a data structure. It returns
TRUE iff the pattern matches the structure (see HELP MATCHES for details of
the meaning of 'matches').

Any variables that SYSMATCH binds it adds to the list in the variable
POPMATCHVARS. If a variable in the pattern is already in POPMATCHVARS then
SYSMATCH uses its existing value rather than giving a new value. MATCHES is
defined in terms of SYSMATCH, thus:

    define 4 structure matches pattern;
    vars popmatchvars;
        [] -> popmatchvars;
        sysmatch(pattern, structure)
    enddefine;

See HELP * MATCHES.
