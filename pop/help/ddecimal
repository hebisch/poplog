"ddecimal" is the -dataword- for extra-accurate real numbers (double
decimals).

See TEACH *DECIMALS for a tutorial introduction to the treatment of
decimal numbers in the POPLOG system, and REF *NUMBERS for a summary of
operations on these numbers. See HELP *DECIMALS for the distinction
between "single" and "double" decimals.
