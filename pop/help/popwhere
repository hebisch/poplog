HELP POPWHERE                                        Chris Slymon, June 1983

    popwhere(word or string)
OR
    <enter> popwhere <item>

Disclaimer:-
This file describes the first release of an index to system and library files
and the associated accessing procedures. Further developments will occur
whenever they are thought to be necessary.

Given a word or string, POPWHERE prints all the entries in the index of system
and library procedures which contain the given item as an initial substring.
indicating the source files for all the procedures defined in the system
source and library directories

e.g.
    popwhere('item');

will print the following

Index entries starting with "item" -

        item_chartype [pop.src]item.p
        item_chartype updaterof [pop.src]item.p
        itemread [pop.src]rditem.p

VED procedure ENTER POPWHERE displays a similar message, on the status line,
if there is only one entry in the index.
