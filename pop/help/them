HELP THEM                                        John Williams, Jan 1991

The global variable THEM is used by various *DATABASE procedures to
store the last set of items they have operated on.

*ALLADD saves a list of the items added to the database in THEM.

*ALLREMOVE and *FLUSH save a list of the items removed from the database
in THEM.

In the case of *ALLPRESENT and *AREIN, THEM is set to the list of
matching database items.

Each time round a *FOREVERY loop, the variable THEM holds a list of the
currently matching database items.
