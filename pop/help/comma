HELP COMMA                                          Steven Hardy, March 1982

The comma is used to separate expressions and imperatives. It can be used
anywhere that the semi-colon can. Usually, it is used to separate the arguments
to a procedure call.

See HELP *SEMICOLON - for use of the semicolon in POP-11
