HELP SYS_MACHINE_TYPE                        Robert Duncan, 5 April 1989

A list of words and numbers describing the generic machine type on which
Poplog is running.

The current possible values for sys_machine_type are:

    [vax]
    [sun3]
    [sun4]
    [hp9000 300]
    [hp9000 700]
    [decstation]
    [iris]

This information is used by LIB * SYSDEFS to define a set of global
constants -- VAX, SUN4, etc. -- which can be used in conjunction with
the conditional compilation construct #_IF to compile different versions
of a program for use on different machines.

For full details refer to HELP * SYSDEFS.
