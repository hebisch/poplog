HELP SYSPRMISHAP                                Steven Hardy, March 1982

    sysprmishap(<string>,<list_of_culprits>)
or
    sysprmishap(<culprit1>, <culprit2>,...<integer>,<string>)

This procedure prints the familiar *MISHAP messages, using *SYSPRMESSAGE
to output the message to *CUCHARERR. The arguments to the procedure can
be in one of two forms. The first - and recommended form - is a string
(a description of the mishap) and a list of things involved in the
mishap. The second form is a number of culprits, an integer and a
string. Thus:

    sysprmishap('NON NUMBERS FOR ADDITION', [%x, y%]);

is equivalent to:

    sysprmishap(x, y, 2, 'NON NUMBERS FOR ADDITION');

SYSPRMISHAP is the initial value of the variable PRMISHAP; this value can be
altered if you wish to change the style of mishap messages.

If the variable POPMISHAPS is not FALSE then SYSPRMISHAP assumes it is a list,
and appends to the list an abbreviated version of the error message. This
enables you to enquire about an earlier error after the information has been
lost from the screen. To suppress this do

    false -> popmishaps;
