ENDPROCEDURE                            Revised by Fran Evelyn, July 85

This marks the end of an anonymous procedure, defined using the format:

    procedure(<formal parameters>) -> <output parameters>;
        <body>
    endprocedure;

The procedure built is left on the stack, thus:

    procedure(x); x + 1 endprocedure =>
    ** <procedure>
