HELP NONOP                                          Steven Hardy, January 1978

    nonop <operation identifier>

If NONOP precedes the name of an operation identifier it prevents the named
procedure being applied (as would normally be the case with an operation
identifier). For example

    nonop + -> f;

assigns the addition procedure to F, e.g.

    f(3,4) =>
    ** 7

Note that

    + -> f;

would attempt to APPLY the addition procedure, and assign the RESULT to F.
This would probably produce a run-time error.
