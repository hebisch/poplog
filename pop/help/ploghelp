PLOGHELP <filename>
<ENTER> PLOGHELP <filename

Searches for a Prolog HELP file called <filename>, using PLOGHELPLIST.
This defaults to VEDHELPLIST with the four following directories added:

    $poplocal/local/plog/help
    $poplocal/local/plog/teach
    $usepop/pop/plog/help
    $usepop/pop/plog/teach

If a non-alphabetic symbol such as "+" or "=.." is given as the argument
to PLOGHELP, then the HELP file (if any) which discusses the symbol will
be displayed.  See HELP * SYMBOLS for a list of the symbols used in
POPLOG Prolog.

The user can alter PLOGHELPLIST.
