HELP VEDOUT                                          A. Sloman July 1982

    vedout(<file>,
           <returntofile>,
           <onscreen>,
           <initialise>,
           <terminate>) -> <consumer>

VEDOUT takes five arguments and returns a character consumer to write to
a file.

    <file> - file name, must be a string or a word. The name of the
    buffer to be written into.

    <returntofile> -  a  boolean value that controls whether the
    previous window (if different from the one used for insertion)
    is restored after each character is inserted.

    <onscreen> - a  boolean value that controls whether the
    insertions are shown on the screen.

    <initialise> - a procedure (e.g. VEDENDFILE, or VED_CLEAR) to
    be run once on the file, before the character consumer is
    created.

    <terminate> - a procedure to be run when the character consumer
    is given TERMIN.

If <onscreen> is TRUE, VEDSCREENFLUSH may have to be called after
writing has finished to make the output appear on the screen, as the
output to the screen is buffered.

If this is called from outside the editor, with <onscreen> TRUE, the
screen may get in a confused state.

With RETURNTOFILE TRUE the character consumer may be very slow, as it
changes files after outputting each character.

To avoid  overheads,  the  status  line  is  not  updated  after  each
character.  Hence the line number will be misleading.
