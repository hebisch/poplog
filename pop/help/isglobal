HELP ISGLOBAL                           Jonathan Laventhol, August 1984.

    isglobal(word) -> boolean;

Identifiers can be declared "global", which means that they will be
automatically imported down the section tree from the highest section they
are exported to.  (Note that this isn't the same as a declaration outside
of a procedure -- that's also global, but in a different sense.)

See HELP * SECTIONS, * VARS and REF * SECTIONS

You can find out if an identifier is global like this:

    ;;; all system identifiers are global
    isglobal("isglobal") =>
    ** <true>

    ;;; most user ones aren't
    vars x;
    isglobal("x") =>
    ** <false>

    ;;; but you can make them so
    global constant baz;
    isglobal("baz") =>
    ** <true>
