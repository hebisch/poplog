    ppr(ITEM)

This procedure is used for printing things in an easily readable format.
It takes one argument, the item which is to be printed. If the argument
is a list, the list brackets are not printed. Instead -ppr- is applied
to all the elements of the list. If the argument is not a list it is
printed with -spr-. See REF *PPR for details.
