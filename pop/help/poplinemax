    <integer> -> poplinemax

Together with *POPLINEWIDTH, this variable controls the format of output to
the standard output and error channels (i.e. when writing to the terminal
using *CHAROUT or *CHARERR). POPLINEMAX specifies the maximum number of
characters to be output on any line; after this number a newline will inserted
and the next line commenced with a tab. The value of POPLINEMAX is
user-assignable. Its default value is 78.
