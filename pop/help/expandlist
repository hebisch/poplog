HELP EXPANDLIST                           Mark Rubinstein  February 1986

    expandlist(list) -> list;

EXPANDLIST takes a list as argument a list and returns the same list.  If
the list is a dynamic list (see HELP * PDTOLIST) then -expandlist- will
expand all its elements and make the list static.

This procedure will loop forever if the list is of infinite length.

See also HELP * PDTOLIST, *ISDYNAMIC and REF * LISTS

--- Example ------------------------------------------------------------

    vars list = pdtolist(incharitem(stringin('the cat sat on the mat')));

    isdynamic(list) =>
    ** <procedure>

    expand(list) -> list;
    isdynamic(list) =>
    ** <false>

    list =>
    ** [the cat sat on the mat]
