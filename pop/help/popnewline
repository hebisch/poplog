HELP POPNEWLINE                                      Steven Hardy, March 1982

    <boolean> -> popnewline;

If the variable POPNEWLINE is set to TRUE, then when the itemiser encounters a
newline character in the input, instead of ignoring it it will return the
word NEWLINE. This facility can be used to write procedures like *READLINE,
which stops reading items in when it encounters the word NEWLINE.

The default value of POPNEWLINE is FALSE. It is user-assignable.
