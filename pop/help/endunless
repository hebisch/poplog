HELP ENDUNLESS                             Revised: Fran Evelyn Jul 1985

This marks the end of an -unless- statement which takes the form:

    unless <CONDITION> then <ACTION>
        ...
    endunless

It is equivalent to:

    if not(<CONDITION>) then <ACTION>
        ...
    endif

-unless- statements may have *ELSE, *ELSEIF, and *ELSEUNLESS branches.
