LOGICAL NAMES FOR VED KEYS

Documentation on VED should, wherever possible, be terminal independent.
(See also HELP * STANDARDS). Refer to keys or key-sequences by their
logical names as opposed to their numbers and position on your keyboard.

Derive logical names for ENTER commands (listed in REF * VEDCOMMS), by
removing the prefix "ved_" from the procedure name, and replacing it
with ENTER. E.g.
    ENTER q
    ENTER lcp

Derive logical names for other VED functions by omitting the prefix
"ved" from names of procedures. E.g. the key that invokes
-vedscreendown- is referred to as the SCREENDOWN key. Use upper case in
documentation. Users can look at REF * VEDPROCS to find the full
definition of corresponding VED procedures.

To distinguish function keys set up for VED and the standard terminal
keys (e.g. <SHIFT>, <TAB>, <RETURN>), the names of the latter are
sometimes put between angle brackets in VED documentation.

Below is a list of standard logical names for VED keys or KEY sequences,
including a sample of ENTER commands.

LINEDELETE - delete current line

MARKHI - mark end of range

NEXTHELP - move cursor to next cross reference to a documentation
            file (e.g. the asterisk in HELP * DOCUMENTATION)
NEXTLINE - move cursor to beginning of next line
NEXTSCREEN - move edit window one screenful down. See also PREVSCREEN

POPKEY - go to position pushed onto the stack
PREVHELP - move cursor to previous cross-reference to a documentation
            file (e.g. the asterisk in HELP * DOCUMENTATION)
PREVSCREEN - move edit window one screenful up. See also NEXSCREEN
PUSHKEY - push current position onto the stack

REFRESH - refresh the screen

SCREENDOWN - move to the bottom of the window or down a window if at
             bottom
SCREENLEFT - move to beginning of current line
SCREENRIGHT - move to right of window
SCREENUP - move to top of window, or up a window if already at top
SETSTATIC - switch static mode on and off
STATUSSWITCH - move cursor from staus line to file, or vice versa,
    leaving a mark at the left of the current cursor line when putting
    the cursor on the status line.

TEXTLEFT - move to beginning of text on current line
TEXTRIGHT - move to right of text on current line
TOPFILE - go to the top of the file

WORDLEFT - move cursor left a word
WORDLEFTDELETE - delete word to left of cursor
WORDRIGHT - move cursor right a word
WORDRIGHTDELETE - delete word to right of cursor

ENTER commands:
These can be indicated as ENTER or <ENTER> followed by the command to be
typed. For a full list see REF * VEDCOMMS. Examples are:

ENTER m
    - move marked range to after current line

ENTER t
    - transcribe marked range to after current line

ENTER yankw
    - undelete last part line/word deleted by CLEARHEAD, CLEARTAIL,
      DELETEWORDLEFT, DELETEWORDRIGHT

ENTER yankl
    - undelete line last deleted by LINEDELETE

ENTER ti
    - transcribe (copy) in marked range from previously edited file

ENTER mi
    - move in marked range from previously edited file

ENTER jp
    - Justify current paragraph

ENTER lmr
    - load marked range

ENTER lcp
    - load current procedure (or other definition, e.g. in ML).

ENTER mcp
    - mark current procedure (or other definition, e.g. in ML).

Warning, ENTER commands that make use of an argument cannot be mapped
on to key sequences without taking special precautions to set up the
argument string. The "ENTER dk <vedfunction>" command makes this easy.
See HELP * DK

    on to key strokes.

    keyboards.
