HELP READLINE                            updated Mark Rubinstein  October 1985

    readline() -> list;

This procedure reads all items (using *READITEM) from *PROGLIST with
*POPNEWLINE set to TRUE (so that a newline is returned as the word NEWLINE),
stopping when NEWLINE is encountered.  It then returns a list of all items
read; this will be [] if just return is pressed.

For example

    readline() =>
    ? this is typed by the user
    ** [this is typed by the user]

The prompt used must be a string (but see HELP * GETLINE and * REQUTESLINE),
and is held in POP_READLINE_PROMPT.

which users can change. The default is '? '.
