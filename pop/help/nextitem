HELP NEXTITEM                                       Steven Hardy, March 1982

    nextitem() -> item

NEXTITEM behaves like *ITEMREAD but it does NOT remove the next item from
PROGLIST (so that another call of NEXTITEM will return the same item again)

Note that, as with ITEMREAD, if the next item is a macro, it will be expanded.

See REF *PROGLIST for more details of the use of ITEMREAD during the
compilation process. For further information on input/output procedures, see
REF *CHARIO, REF *SYSIO.

    *READITEM   - similar to ITEMREAD, but no macro expansion or autoloading
