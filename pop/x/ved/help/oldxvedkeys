-- INTRODUCTION -------------------------------------------------------

XVed will normally attempt to determine the type of keyboard it is
attached to and apply appropriate key bindings. If XVed cannot identify
a keyboard then the bindings in the source file SRC * VEDXVEDKEYS.P are
used. This file gives a description of the default key bindings supplied
by this library.


-- NOTATION -----------------------------------------------------------

The descriptions of the key bindings use the following notation:

    ^A
    The single character generated by pressing the <CTRL> key and the
    "A" key simultaneously.

    ESC A
    The sequence of pressing and releasing the <ESCAPE> (ESC) key and
    then pressing the "A" key.

    META A
    The sequence generated by pressing the <META> modifier key
    and the "A" key simultaneously. The META key is sometimes marked
    "Left" or "Alt". These bindings should hold true for all XVed
    keyboard types.

    KP-X
    The "X" key on the keypad (usually on the right hand side of the
    keyboard

    fN
    Function key N. The amount and name of function keys vary from
    keyboard to keyboard.

    LF
    The line-feed key.

    BS
    The back-space key.

    DEL
    The delete or erase key.

    UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT
    The normal cursor keys.

    PRIOR, NEXT, HOME, END, INSERT
    These keys vary from keyboard to keyboard and may not exist as a
    single key press, or have a different name from the one given above.
    The names used here are those from the logical KeySym names used in
    X.


-- INTERACTIONS BETWEEN MOTIF AND XVED --------------------------------

If you are using Motif there is a possibility that there will be
interactions between the Motif "virtual key bindings" and your XVed
keyboard setup. For example most Motif systems have the function key f10
bound to the the virtual key osfMenuBar which cause keyboard focus to
move to the first item on the menu bar. This process will override any
binding XVed places on the key.

One way of overcoming this is to rebind the XVed function to another key
using the normal methods (see HELP *VEDSET.)

Another would be to change which key is used to switch to the menu bar.
You can do this by altering the menuAccelerator resource of the menu bar
in XVed. For more information see REF *RowColumnWidget. As an example
adding the following to your resource file would cause the key
combination Shift-f10 intead of osfMenuBar to be used to shift focus to
the menu bar:

    XVed*menuAccelerator: Shift <Key>F10

You could also redefine which key osfMenuBar is bound to. If you are
using the MWM window manager you could add the following line to your
".motifbind" file:

    osfMenuBar  :Shift  <Key>F10

This would redefine osfMenuBar as Shift-f10, instead of f10 (for more
information see the manual for MWM.)

Altering your ".motifbind" file will alter the behaviour of the virtual
key bindings in all the Motif applications which you are using. If you
would prefer to alter just the behaviour of XVed you could instead alter
the resource named defaultVirtualBindings. For example the following
would again redefine osfMenuBar as Shift-f10.

    XVed*defaultVirtualBindings: \
        <... other virtual bindings...>
        osfMenuBar :Shift  <Key>F10\n\
        <... other virtual bindings...>

For more information see man 3 VirtualBindings under Motif.
