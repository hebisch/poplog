-- INTRODUCTION -------------------------------------------------------

XVed will normally attempt to determine the type of keyboard it is
attached to and apply appropriate key bindings. The key bindings
specific to Sun workstations are provided in the library LIB
*VEDSUNXVEDKEYS which, in combination with the key bindings in the
source file SRC * VEDXVEDKEYS.P, give the key bindings used by XVed on
Sun workstations. This file gives a description of these bindings.


-- MOTIF AND XVED -----------------------------------------------------

See HELP *XVEDKEYS for information on possible interactions between
Motif and XVed.


-- NOTATION -----------------------------------------------------------

The descriptions of the key bindings use the following notation:

    ^A
    The single character generated by pressing the <CTRL> key and the
    "A" key simultaneously.

    ESC A
    The sequence of pressing and releasing the <ESCAPE> (ESC) key and
    then pressing the "A" key.

    KP-X
    The "X" key on the keypad (usually on the right hand side of the
    keyboard

    Fx
    One of the function keys F1 to F9 at the top of the keyboard.

    Lx
    One of the function keys L1 to L10 to the left of the keyboard.

    Rx
    One of the function keys R1 to R15 to the right of the keyboard.

    LF
    The line-feed key.

    BS
    The back-space key.

    DEL
    The delete or erase key.

-- SUN TYPE 4 KEYBOARDS -----------------------------------------------

On newer machines (eg. SPARCstations) with Type 4 keyboards, the numeric
keypad has some extra keys. These are bound as follows:

-           Redo the last command                   vedredocommand
+           Switch between buffer and status line   vedstatusswitch
ENTER       Move to the status line                 vedenter
0   [INS]   Move one word to the left               vedwordleft
.   [DEL]   Move one word to the right              vedwordright

On the Type 4 keyboard, the keys L6, L8 and L10 are also labelled
"Copy", "Paste" and "Cut". Normally, XVed will assign other functions to
these, as shown above. However, for compatibility with other
applications, setting the resource "EditKeysEnabled" to be true in the
user's X defaults file will cause these keys to be mapped to "Copy",
"Paste" and "Cut". See REF *XVED/EditKeysEnabled for more details.
