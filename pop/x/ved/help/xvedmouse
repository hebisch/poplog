1  Introduction
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The library LIB * vedxvedmouse provides the basic mouse settings used by
XVed. There are two possible settings for this library. If the XVed
application resource * UseOldMouseBindings is set true, then the mouse
bindings prior to Version 15+ are used. If UseOldMouseBindings is false,
the default XVed bindings are used. (Note that UseOldMouseBindings
defaults to true for Openlook XVed, but to false for Motif and Vanilla
XVed.)

The mouse bindings are specified with an extension to * vedset, see
REF * XVED/vedset for details.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2  Notation Used
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

BUTTONS     These refer to the buttons on the mouse. The number of
            buttons varies from machine to machine and what is referred
            to below as, for example, BUTTON 3, might refer to pressing
            both buttons simultaneously on a two button mouse.

CLICKing    This refers to quickly pressing and releasing a mouse
            button.

DRAGing     This refers to pressing a mouse button, then moving the
            mouse while keeping the button pressed.

HOLDing     Pressing a mouse button and not releasing it after a time
            exceeding twice that of the application value
            * MultiClickTimeOut (which is 1/5 second by default).

3  Default XVed Mouse Settings (Except Openlook)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The default XVed mouse bindings are as follows:

CLICK BUTTON 1
    If the pointer is on 'active' text containing a text action or a "*"
    documentation reference, obey the action or fetch the documentation
    file.
    Otherwise, move the cursor to the pointer position.

CLICK THEN DRAG BUTTON 1 (ie, press-release-press & hold)
    This causes the window to go into a "vertical scrolling" mode. The
    entire file will move up/down when the mouse is moved up/down. The
    scrolling mode terminates when button 1 is released.

CLICK TWICE THEN DRAG BUTTON 1 (ie, p-r-p-r-p & hold)

    entire file will move left/right when the mouse is moved left/right.
    The scrolling mode terminates when button 1 is released.

    "Drag" the cursor around the window. Dragging off screen will cause
    the VED buffer to scroll in the appropriate direction.
