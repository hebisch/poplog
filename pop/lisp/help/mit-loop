HELP MIT-LOOP                                    John Williams, Nov 1991
                                                        Updated May 1995

The MIT-LOOP module has been withdrawn, since Poplog Lisp now includes
the complete loop macro in the startup image.

See REF * LOOP for details of the syntax of the loop macro.
