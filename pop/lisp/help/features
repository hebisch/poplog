HELP FEATURES                                    John Williams, Aug 1989
                                         Revised John Williams, Aug 1993

This file lists the symbols included in the *features* list by Poplog
Common Lisp. The *features* list is examined by the Lisp reader when
processing #+ and #- expressions.

The first three symbols are :poplog, :common, and :clos.

These are followed by further items that describe the platform Poplog is
running on.

First, the generic machine type. Possible values are:

    :alpha
    :decstation
    :hp9000 followed by either the integer 300 or 700
    :mips
    :sun3
    :sun386
    :sun4
    :symmetry
    :vax

Next, there is a symbol or integer representing the CPU type. The
possible values are:

    :alpha
    :hppa
    :mips
    :sparc
    :vax
    68020
    80386

Finally, there are some symbols and numbers that specify the operating
system type and version. The first such symbol will be either :unix or
:vms. If :vms, it will be followed by a single-float indicating the
current version of VMS. If :unix, it will be followed by two items. The
first is a symbol indicating the particular implementation of Unix,
which will be one of:

    :bsd
    :dynix
    :hpux
    :osf1
    :riscos
    :sunos
    :ultrix

and the second is the version number, as a single float.

Finally, if the operating system is Posix compliant, the symbol :posix
will be present in *features*.


Example

The *features* list of a SPARCstation 1 running Solaris 2.4 will be:

    (:POPLOG :COMMON :CLOS :SUN4 :SPARC :UNIX :SUNOS 5.3 :POSIX)
