This file  briefly  describes  the functions,  variables  and  constants
documented in Chapter 10  of the standard Common  Lisp guide, which  is:
Common Lisp: The Language (Guy L. Steele, Digital Press, 1984).


-------------------------------------------------
1  A Listing of Functions Variables and Constants
-------------------------------------------------

(copy-symbol symbol &optional props)                          [function]
        Returns a  new uninterned  symbol with  the same  print name  as
        symbol. If props is non-NIL then the initial value and  function
        definition of  the new  symbol  will be  the  same as  those  of
        symbol, and the property list of  the new symbol will be a  copy
        of symbol's. If props is nil the new symbol will be unbound  and
        undefined and its property list will be empty.


(gensym &optional x)                                          [function]
        Returns a new, uninterned symbol, whose print name consists of a
        string prefix followed by an integer. By default, the prefix  is
        "G"  and   the   integer   is  the   value   of   the   variable
        *gensym-counter*, which is then  incremented by 1. However,  the
        optional argument x may be  used to specify a particular  prefix
        or integer  (in  which case  the  value of  *gensym-counter*  is
        unaffected).


*gensym-counter*                                              [variable]
        Counter used by gensym in generating unique symbol names. It  is
        incremented each time gensym is called with 0 arguments.


(gentemp &optional prefix package)                            [function]
        Returns a new, interned  symbol. prefix defaults  to "T" and  if
        specified is not remembered from one call to the next.


(get symbol indicator &optional default)                      [function]
        Returns the value associated with indicator in symbol's property
        list, or default if none is found.


(get-properties place list)                                   [function]
        Like getf except that  the second arg is  a list of  indicators.
        get-properties searches the  property list stored  in place  for
        any of the indicators in list until it finds the first  property
        whose indicator is one of the elements of list. Returns 3 values
        : indicator and value for the first property and the tail of the
        property list whose car is indicator. The third value serves  as
        a flag indicating success or failure and also allows the  search
        to be restarted after the property found.


(getf place indicator &optional default)                      [function]
        getf searches the property list stored in place for an indicator
        eq to  indicator. If  one is  found the  corresponding value  is
        returned; otherwise default is returned (defaults to nil). There
        is no way to distinguish an absent property from one whose value
        is default.


(keywordp object)                                             [function]
        Returns true  if object  is  a symbol  interned in  the  keyword
        package.


(make-symbol string)                                          [function]
        Creates a new uninterned symbol whose print name is string.  The
        value and function  bindings will  be unbound  and the  property
        list will be empty.


(remf place indicator)                                           [macro]
        remf removes from the  property list stored  in place the  entry
        (indicator/value pair) with an  indicator eq to indicator.  remf
        returns nil if no such property is found.


(remprop symbol indicator)                                    [function]
        Removes the property from symbol eq to indicator. Returns nil if
        no such property exists or non-nil if a property was found.


(symbol-name symbol)                                          [function]
        Returns the print name of symbol.


(symbol-package symbol)                                       [function]
        Returns the home  package of  symbol, or  nil if  symbol is  not
        interned in any package.


(symbol-plist symbol)                                         [function]
        Returns the property list belonging to symbol.
