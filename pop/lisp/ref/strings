This file  briefly  describes  the functions,  variables  and  constants
documented in Chapter 18  of the standard Common  Lisp guide, which  is:
Common Lisp: The Language (Guy L. Steele, Digital Press, 1984).

1  A Listing of Functions Variables and Constants

        char returns the character at position index in string.


(make-string number &key :initial-element)                    [function]
        Returns a string of length number whose elements are initialised
        to :initial-element.


(nstring-capitalize string &key :start :end)                  [function]
        Destructively modifies the argument  string such that the  first
        character of every word is a capital letter.


(nstring-downcase string &key :start :end)                    [function]
        Destructively modifies the argument  string such that all  upper
        case letters are converted to lower case.


(nstring-upcase string &key :start :end)                      [function]
        Destructively modifies the argument  string such that all  lower
        case letters are converted to upper case.


(schar string index)                                          [function]
        Returns the character  at position  index of  the simple  string
        string.

        If x is a string,  it is returned. If x  is a symbol, its  print
        name is  returned. If  x is  a string  character then  a  string
        containing that  one character  is returned.  If x  is  anything
        else, an error is signaled.


(string-capitalize string &key :start :end)                   [function]
        Returns a copy of string with the first character in every  word
        delimited by :start and :end capitalised.
