REF files provide  reference-level documentation on  the central  Poplog
mechanisms and faculties such  as text itemisation, compilation,  arrays
and records, input-output facilites, etc, and also information about the
Pop-11 compiler, the core Poplog  facilities for supporting Prolog,  and
the built in editor Ved. There are  separate REF files for LISP and  for
the Poplog X Windows interface, as described below.

1  Introduction
---------------

The core Poplog REF files reside in the directory:

        $usepop/pop/ref

There are also specific REF files available from LISP, not listed below,
in the directory

        $usepop/pop/lisp/ref

System information about Prolog  and Poplog ML is  to be found in  their
HELP files, in

        $usepop/pop/plog/help

and

        $usepop/pop/pml/help

There are also several  REF files, also not  listed below, dealing  with
the Poplog facilities for interacting  with the X Windows system.  These
files are to be found in

        $usepop/pop/x/pop/ref

X users may  get a  list of  the available REF  files by  using the  Ved
command:

        <ENTER> ref xpopindex

(For a more complete overview of Poplog directories see DOC * SYSSPEC)




------------------------
2  doc_index Directories
------------------------

The  standard  Poplog  REF  directories  include  a  subdirectory  named
"doc_index". These contain files that form an index to the REFdirectory.
The index files  are created by  LIB * MKREFINDEX. For further  details,
see HELP * MKREFINDEX.
