ML-Lex Version 1.4 (October 1992).

ML-Lex is a lexical analyzer generator for Standard ML written by Andrew
W. Appel, David R. Tarditi and James S. Mattson at Princeton University.


    ML-Lex is the copyright of Andrew W. Appel, David R. Tarditi and
    James S. Mattson. Please read the copyright notice and  warranty
    disclaimer in the file $popcontrib/pml/mllex/lexgen/COPYRIGHT.


ML-Lex is contributed software and so is installed in the popcontrib
directory tree (see HELP * CONTRIB). The root directory is

    $popcontrib/pml/mllex

The subdirectory

    $popcontrib/pml/mllex/lexgen

contains ML-Lex as distributed with Standard ML of New Jersey (v0.93).
Documentation explaining how to use it can be found in

    $popcontrib/pml/mllex/lexgen/lexgen.doc

To load ML-Lex interactively, compile the file

    $popcontrib/pml/mllex/load.ml

This defines a structure LexGen as described in the documentation. The
library is large and takes some time to load; if you intend to use it
regularly, you are strongly recommended to make a saved image. You can
do this with the shell or DCL command

    pml %nort $popcontrib/pml/mllex/make.ml

This will make the image

    $poplocalbin/mllex.psv

To run the image, do

    pml +mllex <files ...>

This will apply the lexical analyser generator to each filename given as
argument.
