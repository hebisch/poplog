The Edinburgh Standard ML Library, Revision 1.16.

This software is contributed by the University of Edinburgh. Please read
the copyright notice in

    $popcontrib/pml/smllib/library/COPYRIGHT

The library provides a consistent set of functions on the built-in types
of the language and on vectors and arrays, and a few extras. It also
includes a "make" system and a consistent set of parsing and unparsing
functions.

The library is contributed software and so is installed in the
POPCONTRIB directory tree (see HELP * CONTRIB). The root directory for
the library is

    $popcontrib/pml/smllib

The subdirectory

    $popcontrib/pml/smllib/library

contains the library as distributed from Edinburgh and installed with
the '-poplog' option.

Documentation for the library in TeX format can be found in

    $popcontrib/pml/smllib/library/doc

or it can be obtained ready-printed as an LFCS technical report:

To load the complete library, compile the file

    $popcontrib/pml/smllib/load.ml

The library is large and takes some time to load; if you intend to use
it regularly, you should make a saved image (see HELP * make). Model
code for making a library saved image can be found in

    $popcontrib/pml/smllib/make.ml

Compiling this file with the shell/DCL command

    pml %nort -noinit -nostdin -load $popcontrib/pml/smllib/make.ml

creates a saved image

    $poplocalbin/smllib.psv

which can then be run with the command

    pml +smllib
