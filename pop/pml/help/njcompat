HELP NJCOMPAT                               Robert Duncan, November 1994


The library module NJCompat can be used to augment the initial
environment of PML to make it more compatible with that of Standard ML
of New Jersey (SML/NJ).

The intention is to make it easier to port software from SML/NJ to
Poplog. If you have problems compiling a program written for SML/NJ
because it uses identifiers which aren't bound in PML or which are bound
with different types, then try adding the declaration

    open NJCompat;

before compiling the program.

The library comprises a somewhat ad hoc collection of definitions which
have proved to be useful in the past. It does not attempt a full
replication of the New Jersey environment: it includes only a subset of
definitions from the Base environment and nothing from the Library.
Additional definitions are likely to be added in the future.
