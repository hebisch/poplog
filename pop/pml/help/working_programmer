Programs from the book

    ML for the Working Programmer
    L. C. Paulson
    Cambridge University Press
    1991

This software is contributed by Cambridge University Press. Please read
the copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty included with each
source file.

As contributed software, the programs are installed in the POPCONTRIB
directory tree (see HELP * CONTRIB). The principal directory is

    $popcontrib/pml/WorkingProgrammer

The subdirectory

    $popcontrib/pml/WorkingProgrammer/ORIG

contains the original source files as distributed by Cambridge
University Press. The subdirectory

    $popcontrib/pml/WorkingProgrammer/src

contains the same files, but with minor modifications to allow their
compilation in Poplog ML. The complete list of source files is as
follows:

    Lists-Trees.ML
        list and tree examples; a tautology checker
    Functions.ML
        higher-order functions and lazy lists
    Modules.ML
        module examples: functional arrays, priority queues
    Imperative.ML
        imperative data structures
    ParsePrint.ML
        a parser and pretty-printer
    Lambda.ML
        a lambda-calculus reducer
    Hal.ML
        a tactical theorem prover for first-order logic

To make these files readily available, you should compile the
initialisation file

    $popcontrib/pml/WorkingProgrammer/setup.ml

This adds the source directory to the compiler's search path and adds
".ML" as a recognised extension for Standard ML program files (see
HELP *searchpath, *filetype). After this, you will be able to type

    load Lists-Trees.ML
    showlib Functions.ML

etc. to compile or view particular source files.
