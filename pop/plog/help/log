Library program which provides a log file of terminal interaction

Keywords: logging, record


The library program LOG provides a simple facility for recording your
interaction with POPLOG in a disc file. The interaction is always
recorded in a file called PROLOG.LOG.

To load the file type:

    ?- library(log).

This library package makes available the following predicates:

    ?- log.

This turns on logging.  Interactions at the terminal will be recorded,
and anything previously in PROLOG.LOG will be overwritten.

    ?- nolog.

    This turns off logging.

Logging will continue to take place after mishaps and will continue if
you change languages.  However, input to the VED editor will not be
recorded.  The library package enables logging to be turned off and on
from POP-11 as well:

    : LOG;

Start logging

    : NOLOG;

Stop logging

Notice that CAPITAL LETTERS are needed for the POP-11 interface.
