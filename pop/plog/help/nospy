PLOGHELP NOSPY                               Simon Nichols, October 1990

    ?- nospy.
    ?- nospy Spec.

Evaluable predicate which removes spy-points.

The evaluable predicate nospy/0 removes all spy-points.

The single argument form nospy/1 removes any spy-points from the
predicates specified by Spec, where Spec has the same form as the
argument to spy/1: it is either a predicate specification of the form
Name or Name/Arity, or a list of such specifications. Name is an atom
representing the function symbol of one or more predicates.

The VED commands

    <ENTER> nospy
    <ENTER> nospy Spec

are equivalent to the corresponding predicate calls.

See PLOGHELP * SPY for details on the interpretation of the argument
Spec and for general information about the SPY debugging package.
