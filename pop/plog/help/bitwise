Operators for manipulating numbers as strings of bits

    ?- X is A \/ B.
    ?- X is A /\ B.
    ?- X is \A.
    ?- X is A >> N.
    ?- X is A << N.

Keywords: bitwise operations, evaluation


There are a number of operators for manipulating numbers as strings of
bits.  Ignore them unless you know what you are doing. Users are
referred to the POP-11 file REF * DATA.

Be careful with these operations -- if you use them on non-integers then
you may get unpredictable results.

    ?- X is A \/ B.         /* bitwise disjunction */
    ?- X is A /\ B.         /* bitwise conjunction */
    ?- X is \A.             /* bitwise negation */
    ?- X is A >> N.         /* logical shift right */
    ?- X is A << N.         /* logical shift left */
