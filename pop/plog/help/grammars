Overview of HELP files dealing with grammars and natural language

A grammar for a language is a set of rules which specifies what
sequences of words are acceptable as sentences in that language.  The
grammar specifies how words can be grouped together into phrases and
what ordering of phrases can be used to form sentences.  Prolog has a
special notation for expressing grammar rules.  This special notation
was designed to aid people in writing "parsers".  A parser is a computer
program which determines the structure (constructs a "parse tree") for
sentences in a language.

The following HELP files discuss this special notation for grammar
rules, along with other Prolog facilities for developing grammars and
library programs dealing with natural language.
