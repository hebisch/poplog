PLOGHELP CURRENT_FUNCTOR      Jonathan Laventhol, Friday 23rd March 1984
                                Revised by Kathryn Seifert  October 1986

Predicate whose args are a functor name and the most general term for
that functor

    ?- current_functor(Name, Term).

Keywords: functor, term

Unifies Name with a currently defined functor name, and Term to be the
most general term for that functor.  No clauses need exist for the
functor -- compare with 'current_predicate' (see
PLOGHELP * CURRENT_PREDICATE). This will only find functors which have
been named in predicate positions, not those which have only been named
in argument positions.

For example:

    ?- current_functor(member, Y).
    Y = member(_1, _2)
    ? ;
    no
