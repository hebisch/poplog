PLOGHELP CURRENT_OP                      Jonathan Laventhol, 7 July 1983
                                Revised by Kathryn Seifert  October 1986

Predicate whose arguments are the precedence, fix, and atom of a
currently defined operator.

    ?- current_op(Prec, Fix, Atom).

Keywords: operator, precedence, fix


Unifies Prec, Fix, and Atom to be the precedence and fix of the operator
Atom.  So if you wanted a list of the currently defined operators, you
could try this:

    ?- current_op(P, F, A), write(P), tab(1), write(F), tab(1),
       write(A), nl, fail.
