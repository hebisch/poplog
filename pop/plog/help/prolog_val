PLOGHELP PROLOG_VAL                          Robert Duncan, January 1988

Reading POP-11 variables from Prolog.

    ?- prolog_val(PopVariable, Value).

This goal unifies the term -Value- with the current value of the POP-11
permanent variable -PopVariable-. -PopVariable- must be an atom.

For more information about this and for details of how to assign to
POP-11 variables see PLOGHELP * PROLOG_SETQ.
