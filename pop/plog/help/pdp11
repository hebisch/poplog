Library file to restore operator precedences to those of PDP-11 Prolog

Keywords: implementation, PDP11, POPLOG, system, operators, precedences


The precedences of standard operators in PDP-11 Prolog are the same as
the precedences of the standard operators in POPLOG Prolog. Thus,
changing the operator precedences to be the same as those of PDP-11
Prolog has the same effect as restoring the precedences of all the
standard Prolog operators to their default values (see
PLOGHELP * DEFAULT_OPS, PLOGHELP * OPERATORS).   Clearly, this is
unnecessary unless you have changed the default precedence values of the
standard operators. There is a library file, PDP11, which performs the
restoration operation.

To invoke this library, type:

    ?- library(pdp11).

Notice that any (non-standard) operators you may have declared yourself
will NOT have their precedences changed.

See HELP * DEC10 for obtaining DEC System-10 Prolog operator
precedences.
