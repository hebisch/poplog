-- INTRODUCTION -------------------------------------------------------

There are several extensions to the Prolog system in the form of on-line
library programs.  There are two directories for Prolog library
programs: the autoloadable directory, and the standard directory.  The
difference between these two directories is that Prolog can be set up
to search automatically for predicates in the autoloadable directory.
PLOGHELP * UNKNOWN gives more information about this facility.

The predicate 'library/1' will search both directories.  Thus if you do
not use the autoloading feature, you can consider both directories to
be the same.

Users can type to VED

    <ENTER> showlib <filename>

or to Prolog

    ?- showlib <filename>.

to examine the contents of library files.  See PLOGHELP * SHOWLIB for
more information.
