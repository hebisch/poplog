PLOGHELP POPSETQ

LIBRARY POPSETQ has been withdrawn. The predicates previously defined in
it are now built in to the Prolog system. For compatability with
existing programs, an empty file "popsetq.pl" is currently provided in
the main library directory so that the goal

    ?- library(popsetq).

will still succeed, but this will be removed from future versions of
Prolog.

The predicates affected are described in the following HELP files:

    PLOGHELP * PROLOG_SETQ
    PLOGHELP * PROLOG_VAL

Be warned that both of these are now "system predicates" (see
PLOGHELP * SYSTEM) and so cannot be redefined: programs which attempt to
do so will mishap.
