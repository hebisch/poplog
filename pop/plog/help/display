Predicate which writes argument to current output in prefix format

    ?- display(X).

Keywords: input, output, i/o, prefix format

Writes X on the current output in prefix format (as if no operators were
declared).  Any atoms which need quoting will have quotes, and so any
term put out by display/1 should be readable by read/1.
