Library for evaluating POP-11 expressions from Prolog

Keywords: POP-11, Prolog, mixed language programming, evaluation


LIBRARY ARE provides a predicate 'are/2'. This behaves like the built-in
predicate 'is/2' (see PLOGHELP * IS, PLOGHELP * MIXED_LANGUAGES) except
that the evaluation of the "expression" in the second argument can
produce any number of results. The results are put in a list and unified
with the first argument. This facility is only really useful if you are
calling arbitrary POP-11 procedures from Prolog (see
PLOGHELP * PLOGTOPOP).

To load LIBRARY ARE, type:

    ?- library(are).

'are' is declared as an infix operator.  Here are some examples of
its use. Note that some of these only work because the structures passed
to POP-11 don't happen to need dereferencing (see PLOGHELP * TERMSINPOP
for an explanation of dereferencing):

    ?- X are //(10,3).
    X = [1, 3]
    yes

    ?- [] are dl([a,b,c]).
    no

    ?- X are identfn(dl([a,b,c]),dl([d,e,f])).
    X = [a, b, c, d, e, f]
    yes
