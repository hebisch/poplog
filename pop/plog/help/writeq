PLOGHELP WRITEQ              Jonathan Laventhol, Tuesday 20th March 1984
                                Revised by Kathryn Seifert  October 1986

Special form of 'write' predicate.

    ?- writeq(X).

Keywords: output, write, atom quotes, i/o

Writes its argument on the current output.  It uses information about
operators, and puts functors between arguments where it can.  It differs
from write/1 in that it puts atom quotes (hence the suffix) around atoms
which need them.  Anything written by writeq should be readable by
read/1.
