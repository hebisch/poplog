Library program for returning a list representing the date and time

Keywords: date, time

LIB * DATE provides a library predicate for finding the time and date.
To make this facility available, type:

    ?- library(date).
    yes

You will now have the predicate 'date' available.  You will get a six
element list as a result of this argument,  consisting of
    day
    month   (as a three letter abbreviation)
    year    (the whole number)
    hours   (in 24-hour format)
    minutes
    seconds

Thus:

    ?- date(X).
    X = [22, sep, 1986, 20, 24, 30]
    ?
    yes
