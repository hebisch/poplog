PLOGHELP DIV                               Jonathan Laventhol, June 1983

Operator returning the integer result of the division of two integers

    ?- X is <num> div <num>.

Keywords: division, arithmetic, integer, evaluation, operator


A goal of the following form:
        ?- X is Y div Z.
will succeed if X is the integer result of dividing Y by Z. Y and Z must
be instantiated as integers. For example:

        ?- 3 is 10 div 3.
        yes

By default, 'div' is declared with precedence 21 and fix "yfx".

You can get the remainder resulting from the division of one number by
another using 'mod': see PLOGHELP * MOD. You can also divide non-integer
numbers and get ratio or decimal results by using the operator '/': see
PLOGHELP * DIVIDE.
