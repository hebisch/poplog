PLOGHELP DEBUGGING                           Simon Nichols, October 1990

    ?- debugging.

The evaluable predicate debugging/0 displays a list of the currently
active spy-points. If spy-points are leashed, it also prints a message
to that effect. For example:

    ?- debugging.
    There are no spy-points
    yes

    ?- spy append.
    Spypoint placed on append/3
    yes

    ?- debugging.
    There are spy-points on the following procedures:
        append/3
    Spypoints are leashed
    yes

See PLOGHELP * SPY for information about the SPY debugging package.
