Predicate which determines the Nth argument of a given term

    ?- arg(N, Term, Arg).

Keywords: term, arguments, structure


A goal of the form
    ?- arg(N, Term, Arg).
will succeed if the  Nth  argument in Term is Arg.  Both N and Term
must be instantiated.

For example:

    ?- arg(3, foo(a, b, c, d), A).
    A = c ?
