Predicate which changes the prompt used by 'read' and 'get0'.

    ?- prompt(Old, New).

Keywords: input, prompt


This predicate allows you to change the prompt used by 'read' and
'get0'. When called, Old is unified with the current prompt, and New is
unified with the new prompt.  So to find out the current prompt, try

    ?- prompt(Old, _).
    Old = |: ?
    yes

To use it to change the prompt, try

    ?- prompt(_, '--- '), read(X).
    --- hello.
    X = hello ?

The prompt is reset to '|: ' when you return to top level.
