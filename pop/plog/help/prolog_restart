PLOGHELP PROLOG_RESTART                         Robert Duncan, June 1991

Restarting the Prolog system.

    ?- prolog_restart.


The evaluable predicate prolog_restart/0 restarts the Prolog system. A
call to this predicate will never return.

In the normal case, prolog_restart/0 exits from all outstanding goals
and compilation streams, reinitialises the system (which includes
recompilation of the "init.pl" files), prints the version messages and
reenters the Prolog top-level compiler. When called from inside VED
immediate mode, prolog_restart/0 restarts only the immediate mode
compiler. In either case, the state of the database is left unchanged.

prolog_restart/0 is used most commonly on restoration of a saved image:
see PLOGHELP * SAVE.
