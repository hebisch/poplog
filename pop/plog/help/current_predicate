                                Revised by Kathryn Seifert  October 1986

Predicate whose args are a predicate and the most general term for that
predicate

    ?- current_predicate(Name, Term).

Keywords: predicate, term


Unifies Name with a currently defined predicate and Term to be the most
general term for that predicate.  Clauses must exist for Name (compare
with 'current_functor', PLOGHELP * CURRENT_FUNCTOR).

For example:

    ?- current_predicate(X, Y).
    X = member
    Y = member(_1, _2) ?
    yes
