                                Revised by Kathryn Seifert  October 1986

Predicate which prints information about current run of Prolog system

    ?- statistics.
    ?- statistics(Key, Value).

Keywords: CPU time, garbage collection, system


This predicate prints information about the current run of Prolog.  For
example:

    ?- statistics.
    CPU time used: 84.63 seconds. GC time: 2.69 seconds.
    At last garbage collection: 20535 words used and 128265 words free.
    yes

'statistics/2' gives various statistics depending on the value of its
first argument.   Some of the information required for the keys
specified in the DEC10 manual is not meaningful or is not yet available.
In these cases (marked with a star, below), the result will be a
variable.

    ?- statistics(Key, Value).


    Key                                 Value
    ---                                 -----
    core                                [Low*, High*]
    heap                                [Used, Free]
    global_stack                        [Used*, Free*]
    local_stack                         [Used*, Free*]
    trail                               [Used*, Free*]
    runtime                             [Total, Delta]
    garbage_collection                  [Number*, Freed*, Time]
    stack_shifts                        [Local_shifts*, Trail_shifts*, Time*]
