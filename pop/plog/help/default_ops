PLOGHELP DEFAULT_OPS                           Robert Duncan, March 1988


    :- library(default_ops).


LIBRARY DEFAULT_OPS restores the precedences of standard operators to
their default values, i.e to what they were when the Prolog system was
first loaded. A list of the standard operators and their default
precedences can be found in PLOGHELP * OPERATORS.

This library is useful if you have used 'op/3' (perhaps unwittingly) to
redeclare any of the standard operators and need to restore the original
precedences. Loading the library will not change the precedences of any
new operators you may have declared for yourself.
