PLOGHELP RECONSULT                              Robert Duncan, July 1993

Reading procedure definitions from a file.

    ?- reconsult(Files).


reconsult/1 behaves like consult/1 except that procedure definitions
read from Files replace any existing definitions for those procedures in
the database instead of adding to them. (See PLOGHELP * CONSULT)

The Files argument has the same form as that to consult/1, and the same
list notation can be used as shorthand. However, any filename in the
list preceded by the operator '-' is reconsulted rather than consulted,
so that the goal

    ?- [-lib, -program, data].

is the same as:

    ?- reconsult([lib, program]), consult(data).

reconsult/1 is itself an abbreviation for a call to the compiler in
reconsult mode: for full details see PLOGHELP * COMPILE.
