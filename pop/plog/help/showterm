Library package for displaying a tree representing a term

Keywords: term, graphics display

Showterm is a library package to enable any Prolog terms to be displayed
as trees in the VED editor. This can be useful for the beginner who
wishes to get the hang of Prolog terms or for the more advanced
programmer who needs to examine the structure of very complex terms. The
library file is a specialised version of SHOWTREE (see
PLOGHELP * PLOGSHOWTREE).

To load it, type:

        ?- library(showterm).

and thereafter, to display a given Term in the editor, do:

        ?- showterm(Term).

Of course, both of these goals can be put inside programs.

For fiddling with options, the following are available (see
PLOGHELP * PLOGSHOWTREE or HELP * SHOWTREE for more explanation):

        ?- tree_printable.   /* make trees printable on a line-printer*/
        ?- vgap(X).          /* find value of vgap*/
        ?- vgap(6).          /* set value of vgap */
