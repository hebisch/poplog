PLOGHELP GREATERTHAN                          Chris Mellish, August 1982
                                Revised by Kathryn Seifert  October 1986

Operators which compare the numerical magnitudes of expressions

    ?- X > Y.
    ?- X >= Y.

Keywords: numerical magnitude, greater than, operators, symbols,
          arithmetic expressions


A goal of the form
    ?- X > Y.
will succeed if the number X is greater than the number Y.  The
arguments are evaluated, so that
    ?- 1 + 3 > 3 - 9.
will succeed.

A goal of the form
    ?- X >= Y.
will succeed if the number X is greater than  or  equal  to the number
Y.  The arguments are evaluated, so that
    ?- 1 + 3 > 9 + 3.
will fail.

By default, ">" and ">=" have precedence 40 and fix "xfx".
