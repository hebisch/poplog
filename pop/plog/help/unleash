PLOGHELP UNLEASH                             Simon Nichols, October 1990

    ?- unleash.
    ?- unleash(Port).

Evaluable predicate which disables user interaction at spy-ports.

Whenever the control flow of a procedure with a spy-point set reaches a
"leashed" spy-port, a debugging message is printed and you will be
prompted for some response (see PLOGHELP * SPY for the available
options). At an "unleashed" port, the debugging message is still
printed, but execution then continues immediately without prompting.

The evaluable predicate unleash/0 unleashes all spy-ports which are
currently leashed.

The evaluable predicate unleash/1 unleashes the port or ports identified
by its argument: this should be one of the four spy-port names 'call',
'exit', 'redo' or 'fail' or a list of the same.

The predicates unleash/0 and unleash/1 are implemented in terms of the
more general spy_action/2, specifying the "continue" action.
