PLOGHELP CLOSE                               Simon Nichols, October 1991


    ?- close(Stream).


Closes the specified stream, currently open for either input or output.
If Stream was the current input, current input is switched back to the
user's terminal. If Stream was the current output, current output is
switched back to the user's terminal.

Stream must be instantiated to either:

    - an atom representing a file name, such as

        '~/prolog/temp.pl'

    - a POP-11 character repeater.
