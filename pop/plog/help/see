    ?- see(Stream).


Changes the current input stream to be Stream. Stream must be
instantiated to one of:

    - an atom representing a file name, such as

        '~/prolog/temp.pl'

    - either of the two special input stream names: 'user' (which refers
      to the user's terminal) or 'inchan' (which refers to the Prolog
      compiler's input stream);

    - a POP-11 character repeater.

After invoking see/1 on a stream, any subsequent input initiated in the
same top-level goal (whether by read/1, get/1 or similar) will be taken
from the named stream until either it is closed by a call to seen/0 or a
new stream is selected with another "see". For example, the goal:

    ?- see('~/prolog/temp.pl'), read(X).

will read the first term from the file '~/prolog/temp.pl'.

The general behaviour of streams is described in PLOGHELP * I_O.
