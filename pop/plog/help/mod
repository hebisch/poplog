PLOGHELP MOD                               Jonathan Laventhol, June 1983

Operator returning the remainder after the division of two integers

    ?- X is <num> mod <num>.

Keywords: division, remainder, arithmetic, operator, evaluation


A goal of the form:
    ?- X is Y mod Z.

will succeed if X is the remainder after Y is divided by Z. Y and Z must
be instantiated as integers. For example:

        ?- 1 is 10 mod 3.
        yes

We could use this to convert 24 hour clock time into normal time:

    normal(Hours24, Hours12) :-
        Hours12 is Hours24 mod 12.

By default, "mod" has precedence 21, and fix "yfx", although this may be
changed to be in accord with 'base prolog'.
