PLOGHELP PROLOG_COMPILE                     Kathryn Seifert  August 1986

POP-11 procedure which compiles a file of Prolog code

    prolog_compile(<character-repeater>|<string>|<word>|<device>)

Keywords: compile, POP-11, Prolog, mixed language programming


The procedure 'prolog_compile' takes a single argument which can be:

(a) a character repeater (see REF * SYSIO); in this case a stream of
    characters will be read in and compiled until the <termin> character
    is produced (see HELP * TERMIN).
(b) a word or a string representing a file name
(c) a device (see HELP * DEVICE); in this case a character repeater for
    the device is created, and the resulting input stream is compiled

This procedure is equivalent to the procedure 'compile' (see
HELP * COMPILE) except the source text read in and compiled by
'prolog_compile' is expected to be Prolog code.   A mishap will occur if
the Prolog system is not loaded.
