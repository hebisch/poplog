PLOGHELP LESSTHAN                             Chris Mellish, August 1982
                                Revised by Kathryn Seifert  October 1986

Operators which compare the numerical magnitudes of expressions

    ?- X < Y.
    ?- X =< Y.

Keywords: numerical magnitude, less than, operators, symbols,
          arithmetic expressions


Goals of the form
    ?- X < Y.
will succeed if the number X is less than the number Y.  The arguments
are evaluated, so that
    ?- 1 + 3 < 5 + 9.
will succeed.

Goals of the form
    ?- X =< Y.
will succeed if the number X is less than or equal to the number Y.  The
arguments are evaluated, so that
    ?- 1 + 4 =< 0 - 9.
will fail.

By default, "<" and "<=" have precedence 40 and fix "xfx". (see
PLOGHELP * OP and PLOGHELP * OPERATORS).
