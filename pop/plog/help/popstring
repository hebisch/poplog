Library package to put POP-11 strings in Prolog programs

Keywords: POP-11, Prolog, strings, mixed language programming, languages


There is a library package, POPSTRING, For Prolog programmers who need
to put POP-11 strings inside their Prolog programs.  It is important
that you know what you are doing when using POP-11 strings in Prolog, as
it can be very confusing to use non-Prolog datatypes in a Prolog
program.

To load LIBRARY POPSTRING type:

    ?- library(popstring).

The library creates a macro which can precede a Prolog word and will
replace it with an expression which makes a POP-11 string.  This macro
can only be used inside 'prolog_eval' (see PLOGHELP * PROLOG_EVAL,
PLOGHELP * PLOGTOPOP, and PLOGHELP * MIXED_LANGUAGES) because it must be
evaluated in order to make the string.

For example:

    ?- prolog_eval(compile(popstring 'string.p')).

will compile as POP-11 the file 'string.p'.
