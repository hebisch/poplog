Predicate which will succeed if its argument is atomic

    ?- atomic(X).

Keywords: atom, atomic


This goal will succeed if X is not an uninstantiated variable or a
complex term. It could be a number or an atom. X could also be some
other POP-11 object, such as a procedure or a boolean, which is being
manipulated by the Prolog program; see PLOGHELP * MIXED_LANGUAGES.
