Operator which can be used to control backtracking

    ?- !.

Keywords: backtracking, operator, symbol


The "cut" operator.  "cut" commits the system to all choices made since
the invocation of the parent goal.

The only place where you are not allowed to use a cut is in a goal
presented directly to the top level interpreter or as the value of a
variable as a goal.  That is, an error will be caused by:

    foo(X) :- man(john), X, true.

    ?- foo(!).

and by:

    ?- foo(X), baz(X), !, zang(X).
