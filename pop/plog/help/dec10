PLOGHELP DEC10                               Simon Nichols, October 1991

Library which provides some DEC10 Prolog compatibility.

    ?- library(dec10).


LIBRARY DEC10 provides some DEC10 Prolog compatibility as follows:

    --  It changes the precedences of the built-in operators (see
        PLOGHELP * OPERATORS) to be those of DEC10 Prolog by loading
        LIBRARY DEC10_OPS (see PLOGHELP * DEC10_OPS).

    --  It makes available the database facilities of LIBRARY RECORD
        (see PLOGHELP * RECORD).

    --  It makes available the terminal interaction logging facilities
        of LIBRARY LOG (see PLOGHELP * LOG).

    --  It makes available the facilities for altering the action taken
        when an undefined predicate is called, by loading LIBRARY
        UNKNOWN (see PLOGHELP * UNKNOWN).

    --  It provides dummy definitions of the following predicates which
        succeed without taking any action:

            mode/1
            public/1
            fastcode/0
            compactcode/0
            'C'/3
            revive/2
            fileerrors/0
            gc/0
            nogc/0

    --  It provides dummy definitions of the following predicates which
        give an error (with the message "Predicate not implemented") if
        invoked:

            ancestors/1
            subgoal_of/1
            depth/1
            maxdepth/1
            assert/2
            asserta/2
            assertz/2
            clause/3
            nofileerrors/0
            gcguide/3
            plsys/1

    --  The predicate leash/1 is defined to do the same as leash/0 (see
        PLOGHELP * LEASH).

Note that some of the dummy definitions may be replaced with sensible
ones in the future (for mode/1, for example).

See HELP * COMPATIBILITY for a description of differences between POPLOG
Prolog and DEC10 Prolog.
