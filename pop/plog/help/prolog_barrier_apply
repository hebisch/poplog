PLOGHELP PROLOG_BARRIER_APPLY               Kathryn Seifert  August 1986

POP-11 procedure which applies a procedure inside a Prolog 'barrier'

    prolog_barrier_apply(<procedure:P>) -> <result>

Keywords: POP-11, Prolog, mixed language programming


'prolog_barrier_apply' takes a procedure and applies it inside a Prolog
'barrier'.  In other words, when the procedure P exists, the record of
Prolog goals still to be attempted and Prolog variables to be reset on
backtracking will be as it was when P was entered (but no variables will
be specially reset).  Execution of P will thus be isolated from any
other active Prolog executions.

See PLOGHELP * PROCESSES for an example application of this procedure.
