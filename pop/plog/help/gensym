Library program for generating new atoms

Keywords: atom, symbol generation


The library program GENSYM provides a facility to construct new atoms.
To load the program, type:

    ?- library(gensym).

You will now be able to make new words on demand:

    ?- gensym(foo, X).
    X = foo1
    ?

    ?- gensym(foo, Y).
    Y = foo2
    ?
    yes

will give you the atom "foo1" the first time it is called, "foo2" the
second time, and so on.  You can use any word in place of "foo", and you
can have any number of them at the same time.

Each root word leaves an entry in the database like this:

    current_num(foo, 4)

this means that the last word generated from "foo" was "foo4".  If the
entry is missing, it behaves as though there was an entry

    current_num(foo, 0).

Thus you can control the next number if you want to, by retracting the
'current_num' entries for some atoms.  For example, to make the next
word for "foo" to be "foo100", do

    ?- retractall(current_num(foo, _)),     /* always succeeds */
    asserta(current_num(foo, 99)).
