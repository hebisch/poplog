Predicate which forces Prolog startup behaviour

    ?- reinitialise.

Keywords: system, startup


This predicate forces the startup behaviour which happens when you first
enter the Prolog system, namely:

        compile as POP-11        POPSYS:init.p
        reconsult as Prolog      POPSYS:init.pl
        compile as POP-11        POPLIB:init.p
(but if there isn't one, tries init.p in current directory)
        reconsult as Prolog     POPLIB:init.pl
(but if there isn't one, tries init.pl in current directory)
