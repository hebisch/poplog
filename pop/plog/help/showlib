How to examine the contents of POP-11 and Prolog library files

    ?- showlib Filename
    <enter> showlib Filename

Keywords: libraries, documentation, documentation access


The 'showlib' command will cause the library file of the given name to
be displayed on your screen. Note that you don't have to put in the
'.pl' or '.p' with 'showlib', and because it is a special word (a macro)
(see HELP * MACRO), you don't need the dot to signify the end of the
term. You can load the files that showlib will show you using "library".
(See PLOGHELP * LIBRARY).

'showlib' also works from VED, so you can do ENTER SHOWLIB filename.
