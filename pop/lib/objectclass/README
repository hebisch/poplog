Objectclass 10202

This version of Objectclass, provided by Steve Leach on 8 Mar 2003,
fixes problems described in the news file

		help/objectclass_news

linked to NEWS in this directory.

(It contains Ved graphic characters, so some bits of it cannot be read
outside Ved).

=======================================================================
INSTALLATION AND TESTING

If you wish to try this version of objectclass without putting it in
the standard location ( $usepop/pop/lib/objectclass ) you can simply
compile this file in this directory:

    objectclass.standalone.p

That will automatically compile the new version of objectclass and set
all the search paths for program libraries and documentation correctly,
no matter where this directory is located.

You should then be able to make sure that the revised objectclass does
not break any of your old code.

To install this version as the standard version in Poplog, remove or
rename this directory

	$usepop/pop/lib/objectclass

and install this directory in its place, and then rebuild all your saved
images that use objectclass.

To create a local saved image in $poplocalbin, edit the following script
to ensure that it compiles the libraries you want to compile then run

	mkocnewstartup.local

which will create $poplocalbin/ocnew.psv, which can then be run as

	basepop11 +ocnew

[end]
