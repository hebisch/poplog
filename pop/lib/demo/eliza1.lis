ELIZA is a demonstration program which can be both fun and educational.

It demonstrates that computers are not restricted to operating on numbers,
but can also manipulate lists of words.

Whatever you type, ELIZA will give some sort of answer. Talk about anything
you like, politics, computers, your love affairs, your family, etc. You'll
probably get more interesting replies if you make statements, rather than
asking questions.

Try to guess the rules ELIZA uses to form replies. Many of the replies are
based on what you type in, with words re-arranged.

Eliza does not really understand anything. But by trying to write programs
like Eliza we begin to understand a little better what some of the
rules are which the human mind uses for conversations.

Some of the techniques used in Eliza can also be used to make computers
generally much easier to interact with.
