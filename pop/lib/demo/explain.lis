                WELCOME TO THE SUSSEX POPLOG SYSTEM

You are looking at a VDU - a "Visual Display Unit".

The VDU contains a tiny computer which controls how the screen looks. It is
connected by telephone lines to a much larger computer (e.g. a VAX 11/780)
that may be in another building. The computer is used simultaneously by lots
of different people, for different purposes. That is, it is "time shared".

We have prepared a demonstration of some of the programming systems we have
developed at Sussex for teaching and research.

Instructions and questions will be printed on the screen. Please type your
replies on the attached keyboard. Most keys work just like an ordinary
typewriter, except that they cause signals to be sent to the VAX.

To continue, please press the big button marked RETURN. NB. press it once,
and release it quickly: don't hold it down. (The keys repeat if held down).
After you press the button, there may be a delay before the computer
responds.
