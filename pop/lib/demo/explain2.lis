This demonstration will introduce you to a subset of the POPLOG system.
In particular, you will be offered a simple typing lesson, to help you get
used to the keyboard. You can then talk to a program called ELIZA, which
simulates a sort of 'non-directive' psychotherapist, who doesn't really
listen to what you say, but just tries to keep you talking. You can also
exchange insults with a 'stroppy' program produced by a student.

You can then get a lesson on using our 'text-processing' facilities, to
create a file containing either English text or a program. And if there's
time, you can also get a simple introduction to some programming
techniques in POP11 (one of the programming languages in POPLOG).

Incidentally, POPLOG is now in use in many Universities and Colleges,
and many commercial and industrial organisations. It is being marketed
internationally by Systems Designers Ltd. By early 1986 there were over
400 licences worldwide.
