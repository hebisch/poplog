N.B. If you have used any other computing system please don't assume that
the same commands will work on this one.

Please read instructions very carefully, and all should be well.

If you have any difficulties ask one of the 'demonstrators' for help. Don't
be embarrassed about getting stuck. Everyone has some difficulties requiring
help, sooner or later.

Check before you proceed that the key marked "CAPS ONLY" in the bottom left
corner of the keyboard does not have a light on. If it does, press it to make
the light go away. If the light is on, everything you type will be in capital
letters, and some of the demonstrations will not work, as a result.

You will now again be offered a list of options. If you are not used to the
keyboard, you may find the typing lesson helpful.
