Eliza's output mostly consists of either lists of words built in by the
programmer, or rearrangements of the words you type.

The Stroppy program, which you can try next, builds up its own insulting
phrases, using some general rules telling it how to combine elements of
phrases into larger structures. So the insults which are printed out will
mostly not be related to the words you type in, neither will they be phrases
the programmer put in.

In that sense the program shows the beginnings of creativity. However, it
does not really understand what it is saying. Please don't take any of the
insults personally. You can be as rude as you like in return. Try using the
words "computer", "computers", "machine", "machines" in your insults.
