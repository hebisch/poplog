The Sussex University POPLOG system is a collection of programs and 'text'
files (like the one you are now reading) stored on magnetic disks connected to
the VAX computer. The main aim of the system is to teach students how to write
programs in an advanced 'high level' language, with a number of powerful
facilities not normally provided in the more common languages.

In particular, we use it to teach students how to write programs which do
some of the things people can do, like understanding sentences, analysing
pictures, solving problems, playing games.

The aim is partly to shed light on how the human mind works, by trying to
simulate some of its abilities, and partly to develop techniques for making
computers more useful.

This field of study is known as 'Artificial Intelligence'. It links Computing
Science to Psychology, Linguistics and Philosophy.
